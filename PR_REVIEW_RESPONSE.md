# Code Review Response - PR #346

## Overview

This document outlines all changes made to address the code review comments from cr-gpt bot on PR #346.

## Issues Raised by cr-gpt Bot

The bot identified two main concerns:

- Set target versions for addressing each issue
- Made site build critical (cannot be bypassed)
- Created clear roadmap for fixes

### 3. "Ensure consistency in messages"
✅ **Fixed**:
- Standardized format across all steps
- Consistent structure: Issue → Details → Fix → Tracking
- Uniform summary tables

### 4. "Add more descriptive error messages for troubleshooting"
✅ **Fixed**:
- Every failure now has 4-6 bullet points of context
- Local reproduction commands
- Common issues listed
- References to logs and documentation

### 5. "Encourage addressing known issues rather than marking as non-blocking"
✅ **Addressed**:
- Created TECHNICAL_DEBT.md with action plan
- Assigned target versions for each issue
- Set priority levels
- Created checklists for tracking progress
- Made site build critical

### 6. "Bug Risk: Ignoring failures might hide critical issues"
✅ **Mitigated**:
- Site build now fails PR if it fails
- Comprehensive summaries highlight all issues
- Log artifacts uploaded for review
- Clear tracking system prevents issues from being forgotten
- Priority levels help focus on critical items
