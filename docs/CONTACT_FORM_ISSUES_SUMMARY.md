## 🎯 Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (Start Now) ⚡
**Issue #279 - Environment Configuration**
- Get Resend API key (free account)
- Create `.env.local` file
- Configure environment variables
- Test email sending works
- **Time:** 2-3 hours

### Phase 2: Data Persistence (Same Day) 💾
**Issue #280 - Database Persistence**
- Add Prisma schema for ContactSubmission
- Update API to save before emailing
- Create admin interface
- Add retry mechanism
- **Time:** 4-5 hours

### Phase 3: Error Handling (Next Day) ⚠️
**Issue #281 - Error Handling**
- Fix email service error propagation
- Add proper HTTP status codes
- Improve user-facing error messages
- Add fallback contact methods
- **Time:** 3-4 hours

### Phase 4: Documentation (Before Production) 📚
**Issue #282 - Documentation**
- Create deployment guide
- Add health check endpoint
- Document Vercel setup
- Create pre-deployment checklist
- **Time:** 2-3 hours

**Total Estimated Effort:** 11-15 hours

## 🔧 Quick Fix (Temporary)

If you need the form working immediately:

```bash
# 1. Get Resend API key from https://resend.com (free)

# 2. Create environment file
cd apps/site
cat > .env.local << 'EOF'
RESEND_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@schibelli.dev
EMAIL_REPLY_TO=john@schibelli.dev
EOF

# 3. Restart development server
pnpm dev
```

**⚠️ Warning:** This is only a temporary fix. Issues #280 and #281 must be addressed before production deployment.
