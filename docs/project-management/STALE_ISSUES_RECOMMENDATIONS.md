# Stale Issues Recommendations & Action Plan

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

Based on the stale issues analysis, **no issues are technically stale**, but several require immediate attention to prevent them from becoming stale or to address their current state.

## üö® **Immediate Action Required**

### **1. Issue #19: [Docs] Generate and Maintain Integration Documentation**
- **Age**: 27 days (oldest open issue)
- **Priority**: Medium (documentation)
- **Risk**: Becoming stale due to age
- **Recommendation**: **PRIORITIZE OR CLOSE**

**Actions:**
- [ ] **Option A**: Complete the integration documentation (high value)
- [ ] **Option B**: Close if no longer needed (cleanup)
- [ ] **Option C**: Break into smaller, manageable tasks

**Rationale**: This is comprehensive documentation work that could significantly improve developer onboarding. However, it's been open for 27 days without progress.

### **2. Issue #41: Authentication Security Improvements Needed**
- **Age**: 26 days  
- **Priority**: HIGH (security bug)
- **Risk**: Security vulnerability remains unaddressed
- **Recommendation**: **URGENT - ADDRESS IMMEDIATELY**

**Actions:**
- [ ] **Immediate**: Change default admin password (5 minutes)
- [ ] **This Week**: Add rate limiting and error handling
- [ ] **Next Week**: Implement comprehensive security improvements

**Rationale**: Security issues should never remain open for 26+ days. This represents a real security risk.
