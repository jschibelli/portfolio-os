# Getting Started with Autonomous Agents

## What You're About to Learn

This guide will teach you how to use autonomous agents to automatically handle software development tasks. By the end, you'll understand how to set up the system, create issues that agents can work on, and manage the entire process from start to finish.

## Understanding Autonomous Agents

### What They Are
Autonomous agents are AI-powered workers that can:
- Read and understand your requirements
- Implement complete solutions
- Handle all the technical details
- Work without any human intervention

### What They Do
Think of them as specialized team members who:
- **Frontend Agent** - Creates UI components, handles styling, ensures responsiveness
- **Backend Agent** - Builds APIs, manages databases, handles server logic
- **Documentation Agent** - Writes guides, updates documentation, creates tutorials
- **Testing Agent** - Creates tests, improves coverage, ensures quality
- **AI Agent** - Implements AI features, automation, intelligent systems
- **Default Agent** - Handles general tasks and utilities

### How They Work
1. **You create an issue** describing what you need
2. **System analyzes** the issue and assigns the best agent
3. **Agent works independently** to implement the solution
4. **Agent handles everything** from coding to testing to merging
5. **You review and approve** the completed work

## Step 1: Setting Up the System

### Initialize the Autonomous Agent System
Before you can use autonomous agents, you need to set up the system:

```powershell
# This command sets up everything you need
.\scripts\multi-agent-orchestrator.ps1 -Action setup
```

**What this does:**
- Creates agent labels in your GitHub repository
- Sets up project views for tracking agent work
- Configures workload tracking for all agents
- Initializes the merge queue system
- Prepares the system for autonomous work

### Verify the Setup
Check that everything is working:

```powershell
# Check the complete system status
.\scripts\master-automation.ps1 -Action status
```

**You should see:**
- All 6 agents listed (frontend, backend, docs, testing, ai, default)
- Agent status showing "idle" (ready to work)
- System components showing "ready"
- No errors in the setup

## Step 2: Creating Your First Issue

### Writing a Good Issue
For autonomous agents to work effectively, your issue needs to be clear and detailed:

**Good Issue Example:**
```
Title: Add user authentication to the login page

Description:
I need to add user authentication functionality to the login page. This should include:

- Email and password input fields
- Form validation for required fields
- Submit button that calls the authentication API
- Error handling for invalid credentials
- Success redirect to dashboard
- Responsive design for mobile devices

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Login form with email/password fields
- [ ] Client-side validation
- [ ] API integration for authentication
- [ ] Error message display
- [ ] Success redirect functionality
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Unit tests for the component

Technical Notes:
- Use React with TypeScript
- Integrate with existing API endpoints
- Follow current design system
- Include accessibility features
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Clear title** - Describes exactly what's needed
- **Detailed description** - Explains the requirements thoroughly
- **Acceptance criteria** - Defines what "done" looks like
- **Technical notes** - Provides context and constraints

### What Happens Next
When you create this issue:
1. **System analyzes** the content and keywords
2. **Assigns to Frontend Agent** (based on "login page", "React", "UI")
3. **Creates work environment** with proper setup
4. **Generates detailed instructions** for the agent
5. **Agent begins working** completely independently

## Step 3: Letting the Agent Work

### The Autonomous Process
Once you create the issue, the agent takes over completely:

**What the Agent Does:**
1. **Reads your requirements** carefully
2. **Plans the implementation** approach
3. **Creates the login component** with all specified features
4. **Adds form validation** and error handling
5. **Integrates with the API** for authentication
6. **Ensures responsive design** for mobile devices
7. **Creates unit tests** for the component
8. **Commits the code** with proper message
9. **Creates a pull request** with detailed description
10. **Monitors for reviews** and responds to feedback

### Monitoring Progress
You can check what the agent is doing:

```powershell
# Check system status
.\scripts\master-automation.ps1 -Action status

# Check specific agent workload
.\scripts\agent-workload-manager.ps1 -Action status -Agent agent-frontend
```

**What to Look For:**
- Agent status showing "active" or "working"
- Workload showing the agent is assigned to your issue
- No errors in the system status
- Progress updates in the project dashboard

## Step 4: Reviewing the Results

### When the Agent Completes Work
The agent will:
- **Create a pull request** with your login component
- **Include detailed description** of what was implemented
- **Add screenshots** showing the component in action
- **Document the API integration** and usage
- **Provide testing instructions** for verification

### Reviewing the Work
**What to Check:**
1. **Code Quality** - Is the code clean and well-structured?
2. **Functionality** - Does it meet all your requirements?
3. **Testing** - Are there adequate tests for the component?
4. **Documentation** - Is the implementation well-documented?
5. **Integration** - Does it work with your existing system?

### Providing Feedback
If you need changes:
- **Comment on the PR** with specific feedback
- **Agent will read your comments** and understand what's needed
- **Agent will make the changes** and push updates
- **Process continues** until you're satisfied

## Step 5: Advanced Usage

### Using Multiple Agents
You can have multiple agents working simultaneously:

```powershell
# Assign different agents to different issues
.\scripts\enhanced-autonomous-automation.ps1 -IssueNumber 230 -Agent agent-frontend
.\scripts\enhanced-autonomous-automation.ps1 -IssueNumber 231 -Agent agent-backend
.\scripts\enhanced-autonomous-automation.ps1 -IssueNumber 232 -Agent agent-docs
```

**Benefits:**
- **Parallel development** - Multiple features developed simultaneously
- **Specialized expertise** - Each agent handles their area of expertise
- **Faster delivery** - More work completed in less time
- **Better quality** - Specialized agents produce better results

### Managing Agent Workloads
Monitor how busy your agents are:

```powershell
# Check all agent workloads
.\scripts\agent-workload-manager.ps1 -Action status

# Auto-assign to least loaded agent
.\scripts\agent-workload-manager.ps1 -Action assign -IssueNumber 233
```

**What to Look For:**
- **Balanced workloads** - No agent is overloaded
- **Available capacity** - Agents have room for new work
- **Efficient distribution** - Work is spread evenly

### Handling Conflicts
When multiple agents work on related code:

```powershell
# Check for conflicts
.\scripts\merge-queue-system.ps1 -Action conflicts -PRNumber 456

# Process merge queue
.\scripts\merge-queue-system.ps1 -Action process
```

**The System Handles:**
- **Conflict detection** - Identifies when agents might interfere
- **Merge coordination** - Manages the order of merges
- **Conflict resolution** - Automatically resolves simple conflicts
- **Queue management** - Ensures smooth workflow
