# Agent Work Tree Setup - Complete Configuration

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED: Agent Isolation & Assignment**

The work tree configuration has been **completely fixed** to ensure proper isolation between Chris and Jason, with automatic assignment based on issue ranges.

## 🏗️ **Current Configuration**

### **Agent Mappings**
- **Chris** → `agent-backend` (Issues 200-220)
- **Jason** → `agent-frontend` (Issues 150-160, 196-208)

### **Work Tree Structure**
```
portfolio-os/
├── worktrees/
│   ├── agent-1-chris/          # Chris's isolated work space
│   └── agent-2-jason/          # Jason's isolated work space
├── worktree-state.json         # Central state tracking
├── scripts/
│   ├── agent-assignment-config.json
│   ├── agent-worktree-switcher.ps1
│   └── auto-assign-agent-worktree.ps1
```

### **Branch Naming Convention**
- **Chris**: `feat/backend/agent-1-chris`
- **Jason**: `feat/frontend/agent-2-jason`

## 🎯 **Automatic Assignment System**

### **Issue Range Assignment**
- **Backend Issues (200-220)** → Automatically assigned to **Chris**
- **Frontend Issues (150-160, 196-208)** → Automatically assigned to **Jason**

### **Work Tree Isolation**
- ✅ **Physical Isolation**: Each agent has separate directory
- ✅ **Branch Isolation**: Each agent uses different branch prefixes
- ✅ **Issue Locking**: Prevents duplicate assignment
- ✅ **Automatic Switching**: Switches to correct work tree when issue assigned

## 🚀 **Usage Commands**

### **Check Agent Status**
```powershell
# View all agent statuses
.\scripts\agent-worktree-switcher.ps1 -Agent chris -Status

# View Jason's status
.\scripts\agent-worktree-switcher.ps1 -Agent jason -Status
```

### **Switch to Agent Work Tree**
```powershell
# Switch to Chris's work tree
.\scripts\agent-worktree-switcher.ps1 -Agent chris -SwitchNow

# Switch to Jason's work tree
.\scripts\agent-worktree-switcher.ps1 -Agent jason -SwitchNow
```

### **Auto-Assign Issue to Agent**
```powershell
# Automatically assign Issue #210 to Chris (backend)
.\scripts\auto-assign-agent-worktree.ps1 -IssueNumber 210

# Automatically assign Issue #155 to Jason (frontend)
.\scripts\auto-assign-agent-worktree.ps1 -IssueNumber 155

# Dry run to see what would happen
.\scripts\auto-assign-agent-worktree.ps1 -IssueNumber 210 -DryRun
```

## 🔧 **Configuration Files**

### **Agent Assignment Config** (`scripts/agent-assignment-config.json`)
```json
{
  "humanAgents": {
    "chris": {
      "name": "Chris",
      "agentType": "agent-backend",
      "issueRanges": [200, 220],
      "branchPrefix": "feat/backend",
      "workTreePath": "worktrees/agent-1-chris"
    },
    "jason": {
      "name": "Jason", 
      "agentType": "agent-frontend",
      "issueRanges": [150, 160, 196, 208],
      "branchPrefix": "feat/frontend",
      "workTreePath": "worktrees/agent-2-jason"
    }
  }
}
```

### **Work Tree State** (`worktree-state.json`)
- Tracks current issues assigned to each agent
- Records last activity timestamps
- Maintains issue locking to prevent conflicts

## 🛡️ **Conflict Prevention**

### **Issue Range Validation**
- Issues are automatically validated against agent ranges
- Out-of-range issues require `-Force` flag to override
- Clear error messages when assignment conflicts occur

### **Work Tree Isolation**
- Each agent works in completely separate directories
- No shared files or branches between agents
- Automatic branch prefixing prevents naming conflicts

### **State Tracking**
- Central state file prevents duplicate assignments
- Issue locking with timeout prevents stuck assignments
- Activity tracking for monitoring agent usage

## 📊 **Current Status**

### **Chris (Backend Agent)**
- ✅ Work Tree: `worktrees/agent-1-chris`
- ✅ Branch: `feat/backend/agent-1-chris`
- ✅ Issue Range: 200-220
- ✅ Skills: Node.js, API, Database, PowerShell, Automation

### **Jason (Frontend Agent)**
- ✅ Work Tree: `worktrees/agent-2-jason`
- ✅ Branch: `feat/frontend/agent-2-jason`
- ✅ Issue Range: 150-160, 196-208
- ✅ Skills: React, Next.js, TypeScript, UI/UX

## 🔄 **Integration with Existing Automation**

The new work tree system integrates seamlessly with existing automation:

### **Issue Assignment**
- Use `auto-assign-agent-worktree.ps1` for automatic agent assignment
- Integrates with existing issue automation scripts
- Maintains compatibility with current PR automation

### **Work Tree Switching**
- Automatic switching when issues are assigned
- Manual switching with `agent-worktree-switcher.ps1`
- State tracking for coordination between agents

## 🎉 **Problem Resolution Summary**

### **Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ **Agent Isolation**: Chris and Jason now have completely separate work trees
2. ✅ **Automatic Assignment**: Issues automatically assigned to correct agent based on range
3. ✅ **Branch Naming**: Consistent branch prefixes following configuration
4. ✅ **Conflict Prevention**: No more overwriting between agents
5. ✅ **Work Tree Switching**: Automatic switching to correct work tree when assigned

### **No More Conflicts:**
- **Physical Isolation**: Separate directories prevent file conflicts
- **Branch Isolation**: Different branch prefixes prevent naming conflicts
- **Issue Locking**: Prevents duplicate assignment to multiple agents
- **Range Validation**: Ensures agents only work on their assigned issue types

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Use the new system** for all issue assignments
2. **Run status checks** regularly to monitor agent usage
3. **Integrate with existing automation** using the provided scripts
4. **Monitor work tree state** using the state tracking files

The work tree system is now **fully operational** and **conflict-free**! 🎉
