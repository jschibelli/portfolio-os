## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Chris should start immediately** with Issue #279 - it blocks everything else
2. **Jason can prepare** by reviewing Issue #281 but shouldn't start until #279 is done
3. **Use the agent status scripts** to keep the project board updated
4. **Create PRs with base branch `develop`** not `main`
5. **Test thoroughly** before marking issues as complete
6. **Update documentation** as you implement
