## üéØ Release Process Overview

Portfolio OS uses an automated release system that:

1. ‚úÖ Uses **semantic versioning** (SemVer)
2. ‚úÖ Automates release creation via GitHub Actions
3. ‚úÖ Extracts release notes from CHANGELOG.md
4. ‚úÖ Supports pre-releases (alpha, beta, RC)
5. ‚úÖ Generates release notes automatically

## üî¢ Semantic Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

### Version Format

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE]

Examples:
  1.0.0         - Stable release
  1.0.0-alpha.1 - Alpha pre-release
  1.0.0-beta.1  - Beta pre-release
  1.0.0-rc.1    - Release candidate
  1.0.1         - Patch release
  1.1.0         - Minor release
  2.0.0         - Major release
```

### When to Increment

| Version | When to Use | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **MAJOR** (2.0.0) | Breaking changes, major redesigns | Complete UI overhaul, API changes |
| **MINOR** (1.1.0) | New features, backwards compatible | New dashboard features, new pages |
| **PATCH** (1.0.1) | Bug fixes, minor improvements | Fix bugs, update dependencies |

### Pre-Release Types

- **alpha** (`1.0.0-alpha.1`) - Early testing, unstable
- **beta** (`1.0.0-beta.1`) - Feature complete, testing
- **rc** (`1.0.0-rc.1`) - Release candidate, final testing

## üöÄ Creating a Release

### Method 1: Using the Release Script (Recommended)

#### Stable Release

```powershell
# Navigate to project root
cd C:\Users\jschi\OneDrive\Desktop\2025_portfolio\portfolio-os

# Create release
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.0.0"
```

#### Pre-Release

```powershell
# Alpha release
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.0.0" -PreRelease "alpha.1"

# Beta release
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.0.0" -PreRelease "beta.1"

# Release candidate
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.0.0" -PreRelease "rc.1"
```

#### Dry Run (Preview)

```powershell
# Preview what will happen
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.0.0" -DryRun
```

### Method 2: Manual Release

```powershell
# 1. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
# 2. Commit changes
git add CHANGELOG.md package.json
git commit -m "chore: Prepare release v1.0.0"
git push

# 3. Create and push tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0 - Multi-Agent Development System"
git push origin v1.0.0

# 4. GitHub Action automatically creates the release
```

### Method 3: Using GitHub CLI

```powershell
# Create release directly
gh release create v1.0.0 \
  --title "üöÄ Portfolio OS v1.0.0" \
  --notes-file CHANGELOG.md \
  --latest
```

---

## üß™ Pre-Releases

### Why Use Pre-Releases?

- üß™ Test new features before stable release
- üìä Gather feedback from early users
- üêõ Catch bugs before production
- üéØ Staged rollout for risk mitigation

### Pre-Release Workflow

```powershell
# 1. Create alpha for early testing
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.1.0" -PreRelease "alpha.1"

# 2. After testing, create beta
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.1.0" -PreRelease "beta.1"

# 3. Final testing with release candidate
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.1.0" -PreRelease "rc.1"

# 4. Stable release
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.1.0"
```

### Pre-Release Naming Convention

```
v1.1.0-alpha.1   - First alpha
v1.1.0-alpha.2   - Second alpha (if needed)
v1.1.0-beta.1    - First beta
v1.1.0-beta.2    - Second beta (if needed)
v1.1.0-rc.1      - Release candidate
v1.1.0           - Stable release
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automated Release Workflow

### How It Works

The GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) automatically:

1. ‚úÖ Detects when a version tag is pushed
2. ‚úÖ Extracts version number and determines type
3. ‚úÖ Reads release notes from CHANGELOG.md
4. ‚úÖ Creates GitHub release with appropriate title
5. ‚úÖ Marks as pre-release if applicable
6. ‚úÖ Generates additional release notes from commits

### Workflow Triggers

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'      # Matches v1.0.0
      - 'v*.*.*-*'    # Matches v1.0.0-beta.1
```

### Release Title Format

- üöÄ Stable: `Portfolio OS v1.0.0`
- üî¨ Alpha: `Portfolio OS v1.0.0-alpha.1 (Alpha)`
- üß™ Beta: `Portfolio OS v1.0.0-beta.1 (Beta)`
- üéØ RC: `Portfolio OS v1.0.0-rc.1 (Release Candidate)`

### Monitoring Releases

```powershell
# Check GitHub Actions status
gh run list --workflow=release.yml

# View specific run
gh run view <run-id>

# Check latest release
gh release view --web
```

## üîß Common Release Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Stable Release (v1.0.0)

```powershell
# You're currently at v1.0.0 in package.json
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.0.0" -Message "First stable release"
```

### Scenario 2: Bug Fix Release

```powershell
# Fix bugs, update CHANGELOG.md, then:
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.0.1"
```

### Scenario 3: New Feature Release

```powershell
# Add features, update CHANGELOG.md, then:
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.1.0"
```

### Scenario 4: Breaking Changes

```powershell
# Major refactor, update CHANGELOG.md, then:
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "2.0.0"
```

### Scenario 5: Testing New Feature

```powershell
# Create beta for testing
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.2.0" -PreRelease "beta.1"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tag Already Exists

```
‚ùå Tag v1.0.0 already exists!
```

**Solution:**
- Choose a different version number
- Or delete existing tag: `git tag -d v1.0.0` and `git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0`

### Issue: GitHub Action Failed

```
‚ùå Release workflow failed
```

**Solution:**
1. Check GitHub Actions tab
2. Review error logs
3. Common causes:
   - Invalid CHANGELOG.md format
   - Permissions issue
   - Network error

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Re-run the workflow
gh run rerun <run-id>
```

### Issue: Release Not Showing

```
Tag pushed but no release created
```

**Solution:**
1. Check if GitHub Action ran: `gh run list`
2. Verify workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
3. Check repository permissions
4. Manually create release: `gh release create v1.0.0 --notes-file CHANGELOG.md`

### Issue: Wrong Version in Release

```
Release created with wrong version number
```

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Delete the release
gh release delete v1.0.0 --yes

# Delete the tag
git tag -d v1.0.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0

# Create again with correct version
.\scripts\project-management\create-release.ps1 -Version "1.0.1"
```
