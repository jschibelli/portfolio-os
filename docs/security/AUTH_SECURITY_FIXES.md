# Authentication Security Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the security improvements made to address code review feedback from PR #352.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Credentials

**Issue:** Hardcoded admin credentials (`admin@mindware.dev`/`admin123`) posed a critical security risk.

**Fix:** 
- Removed all hardcoded credentials from the codebase
- Authentication now exclusively uses database-stored, bcrypt-hashed passwords
- No fallback credentials exist in any environment

**Impact:** Eliminates backdoor access that could be exploited if source code is exposed.

### 2. Removed Hardcoded Secret Fallback

**Issue:** `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` had a fallback value which could be exploited.

**Fix:**
- Removed production fallback secret entirely
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is required in environment variables for production
- Build-time placeholder allows builds to complete, but runtime authentication requires actual secret
- NextAuth.js validates the secret at runtime

**Impact:** Ensures JWT tokens are always signed with a cryptographically secure secret unique to each deployment, while allowing CI/CD builds to complete successfully.

### 3. Improved Input Validation

**Issue:** Insufficient input sanitization could lead to injection attacks.

**Fix:**
- Added strict email format validation using RFC 5322 compliant regex
- Added password length validation (8-100 characters, per OWASP/NIST guidelines)
- Email addresses are trimmed and converted to lowercase
- Input validation occurs before any database queries

**Impact:** Prevents injection attacks and ensures data consistency.

### 4. Prevented User Enumeration

**Issue:** Different error messages for "user not found" vs "wrong password" could be used to enumerate valid users.

**Fix:**
- Unified error messages for all authentication failures
- Consistent logging message: "Authentication failed - invalid credentials"
- No indication whether email exists in database

**Impact:** Attackers cannot determine which emails are valid accounts.

### 5. Reduced Information Disclosure in Logs

**Issue:** Excessive logging exposed sensitive information about authentication flows and created timing side-channels.

**Fix:**
- Removed logs containing user emails
- Changed log levels appropriately (info/warn/error)
- Error messages log only error.message, not full stack traces
- Success logs only include non-sensitive user ID
- All authentication failures now use identical generic error messages
- Consistent logging prevents timing analysis attacks

**Impact:** Logs can no longer be used to gather intelligence about valid users or system behavior. Eliminates timing side-channels that could enable user enumeration.

## Required Environment Variables

The following environment variables are **REQUIRED** for the application to function:

### NEXTAUTH_SECRET

**Purpose:** Cryptographically secure secret for signing JWT tokens

**How to Generate:**
```bash
# Using OpenSSL
openssl rand -base64 32

# Using Node.js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
```

**Configuration:**
```bash
# .env.local
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-generated-secret-here
```

**Vercel Configuration:**
```bash
# Add via Vercel CLI
vercel env add NEXTAUTH_SECRET

# Or via Vercel Dashboard
# Settings → Environment Variables → Add New
# Name: NEXTAUTH_SECRET
# Value: [your-generated-secret]
# Environments: Production, Preview, Development
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Deployments

1. **Generate a secure secret:**
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

2. **Add to environment variables:**
   - **Vercel:** Settings → Environment Variables
   - **Local:** `.env.local` file

3. **Redeploy application:**
   - Vercel will automatically redeploy on env var change
   - Local: Restart dev server

4. **Verify authentication:**
   - Existing users should be able to log in normally
   - No session data is lost (JWTs will be re-issued)

### For New Deployments

1. Set `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` before first deployment
2. Initialize database with proper user accounts
3. Ensure all user passwords are hashed with bcrypt

## Security Best Practices

### Password Management

- Always hash passwords with bcrypt before storage
- Use a cost factor of 10+ for bcrypt (default is 10)
- Never store plain-text passwords
- Minimum password length: 8 characters (OWASP/NIST guidelines)
- Implement password complexity requirements client-side

### Rate Limiting (Recommended)

Consider implementing rate limiting for authentication endpoints:

```typescript
// Example: Add rate limiting middleware
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit'

const authLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5, // 5 attempts per window
  message: 'Too many authentication attempts, please try again later'
})
```

### Session Management

- JWT tokens are stateless and contain minimal data
- Tokens expire after configured period (default: 30 days)
- Users should re-authenticate for sensitive operations
- Consider shorter session durations for high-security areas

### Monitoring

Monitor authentication logs for:
- Multiple failed authentication attempts (potential brute force)
- Authentication attempts outside business hours
- Authentication from unusual IP addresses
- Rapid authentication attempts (automated attacks)

## Testing

### Verify Security Fixes

1. **No hardcoded credentials:**
   ```bash
   # Should return no results
   git grep -i "admin123"
   git grep -i "fallback-secret"
   ```

2. **Environment variable required:**
   ```bash
   # Start app without NEXTAUTH_SECRET - should fail
   unset NEXTAUTH_SECRET
   npm run dev # Should error
   ```

3. **Input validation:**
   - Try logging in with invalid email format
   - Try logging in with password < 6 characters
   - Verify appropriate error messages

4. **User enumeration prevention:**
   - Try logging in with non-existent email
   - Try logging in with valid email but wrong password
   - Verify error messages are identical
