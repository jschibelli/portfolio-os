# .workspace Directory - Personal Temporary Files

This directory is for **temporary, personal files only**. It's gitignored.

**If you need files accessible to all agent worktrees:**

### Project Documentation
Put permanent project docs here (git-tracked):
```
docs/project-management/
```

### Project Scripts
Put reusable scripts here (git-tracked):
```
scripts/project-management/
```
