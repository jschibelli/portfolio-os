## üéØ Next Steps (3-Agent Coordination)

### Phase 1: Individual PR Review (All Agents)
**Agent 1 (Chris):**
```bash
# Review your own PRs and address feedback
gh pr view 333  # Streaming responses
gh pr view 336  # Analytics
gh pr view 337  # Error handling
gh pr view 340  # Typing + Feedback
gh pr view 334  # Persistence
gh pr view 335  # Quick replies
gh pr view 338  # Modularization
gh pr view 339  # Documentation
```

**Agent 2 (Jason):**
```bash
# Review context window PR
gh pr view 332  # Context window expansion

# Review Agent 1's backend/API changes
gh pr view 333  # Check API route changes
gh pr view 336  # Check analytics implementation
```

**Agent 3 (QA/Integration):**
```bash
# Review all PRs for quality and integration
gh pr list --search "chatbot"

# Test each feature branch
git checkout feature/chatbot-streaming-responses-322
# Test locally...

git checkout feature/chatbot-analytics-tracking-323
# Test locally...

# Continue for all branches...
```

### Phase 2: Merge Strategy (Agent 3 Coordinates)

**Recommended Merge Order:**
1. **#339** - Documentation/Types (no functional changes, safe first)
2. **#338** - Modularization (refactor base, others depend on it)
3. **#332** - Context window (backend change, foundation)
4. **#337** - Error handling (improves reliability)
5. **#336** - Analytics (tracking foundation)
6. **#333** - Streaming responses (core UX improvement)
7. **#340** - Typing + Feedback (builds on streaming)
8. **#334** - Persistence (depends on stable state)
9. **#335** - Quick replies (final polish)

**Merge Commands (Agent 3):**
```bash
# After each PR is approved and tests pass
gh pr merge 339 --squash --delete-branch
gh pr merge 338 --squash --delete-branch
gh pr merge 332 --squash --delete-branch
# ... continue in order
```

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (Agent 3 Leads)

After all merges:
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Test all features together
pnpm dev

# Manual testing checklist:
# [ ] Streaming responses working
# [ ] Typing indicators showing
# [ ] Error messages clear
# [ ] Analytics logging
# [ ] Persistence across refresh
# [ ] Context maintains 15 messages
# [ ] Quick replies appearing
# [ ] Feedback buttons working
# [ ] Component modular and clean
# [ ] TypeScript types correct
```

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (All Agents)

**Pre-deployment checklist:**
- [ ] All PRs merged to `develop`
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Accessibility tested

**Deployment:**
```bash
# Create release PR
gh pr create --base main --head develop --title "Release v1.1.0: AI Chatbot Enhancement"

# After approval
gh pr merge <pr-number> --merge --delete-branch

# Tag release
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "v1.1.0: AI Chatbot Intelligence & UX Enhancement"
git push origin v1.1.0
```
