### Potential Conflicts
- Streaming (#333) + Typing (#340) both modify response handling
- Modularization (#338) changes component structure
- Analytics (#336) adds tracking everywhere

### Conflict Resolution
1. Agent 3 identifies conflict during merge
2. Agent 1 resolves (as file owner)
3. Agent 3 re-tests
4. Continue merge sequence
