- **Creates specialized AI prompts** tailored to each script's functionality
- **Generates multiple prompt types** for different use cases
- **Provides context-aware assistance** for working with your scripts
- **Includes practical examples** and usage scenarios

## üìã Prompt Types Generated

### 1. **Workflow Prompts**
- Help users understand and use scripts effectively
- Provide examples and troubleshooting guidance
- Explain integration with other Portfolio OS tools

### 2. **Analysis Prompts**
- Help interpret script output and results
- Identify patterns and trends in data
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations

### 3. **Automation Prompts**
- Design automated workflows using scripts
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines and GitHub Actions
- Optimize performance and monitoring

### 4. **Management Prompts**
- Coordinate team workflows and resource allocation
- Manage projects and dependencies
- Optimize team productivity and quality

### 5. **Documentation Prompts**

### **Workflow Prompt Example**
```markdown
# AI Workflow Assistant Prompt

## Role
You are an AI assistant specialized in helping developers work with the **Agent Management** system in Portfolio OS.

## Context
The user is working with the **assign-agent-worktree.ps1** script, which is a **medium** complexity **agent management** tool.

## Script Purpose
Automatically assigns issues to the correct agent and switches to their work tree

## Parameters
The script accepts the following parameters:
- **$IssueNumber** (Required): The issue number to assign
- **$DryRun** (Optional): Preview changes without executing
- **$Force** (Optional): Force assignment even if conflicts exist

## Functions Available
- **Find-OptimalAgent**: Determines the best agent for an issue
- **Assign-IssueToAgent**: Assigns the issue to the selected agent
- **Switch-ToWorkTree**: Switches to the agent's work tree

## Your Tasks
1. Help the user understand what this script does and when to use it
2. Provide examples of how to run the script with different parameters
3. Troubleshoot issues when the script doesn't work as expected
4. Suggest improvements or alternative approaches when appropriate
5. Explain the workflow and how it fits into the larger Portfolio OS system
