~~Scripts that have syntax errors or dependency issues~~ **REMOVED**

*The broken scripts have been removed due to multiple complex syntax errors and structural issues. The functionality is available through the working scripts in the `working/` folder.*

## 🚀 **Usage Guidelines**

### **✅ Use Working Scripts**
Always prefer scripts from the `working/` directory for production use.

### **🔧 Core Utilities**
Use `core-utilities/` scripts as building blocks for other automation.

### **❌ Avoid Broken Scripts**
Scripts in the `issue-management-broken/` directory have known issues and should not be used until fixed.

## 🔄 **Script Status**

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **✅ Successfully Tested Scripts:**
- **`issue-analyzer.ps1`** - Works perfectly, analyzes issues with priority/complexity
- **`backfill-project-fields.ps1`** - Works perfectly, processed 30 issues successfully
- **`pr-aliases.ps1`** - Works perfectly, loads PR workflow aliases
- **`project-manager.ps1`** - Works but requires parameters
- **`fix-quotes.ps1`** - Works perfectly, runs without errors

### **❌ Scripts with Issues:**
~~**All broken scripts have been removed**~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**

*The broken scripts had complex syntax errors and structural issues that would require complete rewrites. Since we have working alternatives, they were removed to keep the codebase clean.*

## 📝 **Next Steps**

1. ~~Test all untested scripts~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
2. ~~Fix broken scripts or remove them~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
3. **Consolidate similar functionality** where possible
4. **Create usage documentation** for each working script
5. **Implement automated testing** for all scripts
