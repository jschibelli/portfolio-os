- `manage-projects.ps1` (Main project management script)
- `update-project-status-webhook.ps1` (Webhook integration)
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` (Complete documentation)

### 📁 `scripts/automation/project-management/` (Automation Subfolder)
**Purpose**: Automation-specific project management tools
**Files**:
- `backfill-project-fields.ps1` (12,984 bytes) - **Newer version with more features**

## 🔍 Key Differences

### File Size Comparison
- **Main folder version**: 8,242 bytes (older, simpler)
- **Automation folder version**: 12,984 bytes (newer, more comprehensive)

### Functional Differences
The automation folder version likely includes:
- Enhanced error handling

- More comprehensive logging
- Integration with automation workflows

## 📊 Organization Recommendations

### Option 1: Consolidate into Main Folder
**Pros**:
- Single source of truth
- Easier maintenance
- Clear organization
- Comprehensive documentation already exists

**Cons**:
- May lose automation-specific features
- Need to merge functionality

### Option 2: Keep Both with Clear Separation
**Pros**:
- Maintains automation-specific features
- Clear separation of concerns
- No risk of losing functionality

**Cons**:
- Duplicate maintenance
- Confusion about which to use
- Documentation complexity

### Option 3: Merge and Enhance (Recommended)
**Pros**:
- Best of both versions
- Single comprehensive system
- Enhanced functionality
- Clear documentation

**Cons**:
- Requires careful merging
- Need to test integration

## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan

1. **Analyze the newer version** in automation folder for additional features
2. **Merge functionality** into the main project management folder
3. **Remove duplicate** from automation folder
4. **Update documentation** to reflect consolidated system
5. **Create automation integration** scripts if needed

## ✅ Completed Actions

1. ✅ **Analyzed both versions** and identified key differences
2. ✅ **Identified enhanced features** in automation version (RiskLevel, Dependencies, Testing fields)
3. ✅ **Merged enhanced features** into main version with intelligent analysis functions
4. ✅ **Updated developer guide** with comprehensive documentation
5. ✅ **Cleaned up duplicate files** - removed automation folder duplicate
6. ✅ **Created unified system** with enhanced field mapping and analysis

## 🎯 Final Result

The project management system has been successfully consolidated into a single, comprehensive system with:
