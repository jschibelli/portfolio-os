# Dashboard App Placeholder
# 
# This file ensures the apps/dashboard directory is tracked by Git.
# The dashboard app will contain:
# - Admin interface for content management
# - User authentication and authorization
# - Article creation, editing, and publishing workflows
# - Analytics and reporting features
# - Integration with the main site's content API
#
# Dependencies:
# - Next.js 14+ with App Router
# - Prisma for database operations
# - Authentication via NextAuth.js or similar
# - Tailwind CSS for styling
# - TypeScript for type safety
#
# Security considerations:
# - Role-based access control (RBAC)
# - Input validation and sanitization
# - CSRF protection
# - Rate limiting for API endpoints
