# Dashboard App

## Overview
This dashboard app provides an admin interface for content management and site administration.

## Features
- Admin interface for content management
- User authentication and authorization
- Article creation, editing, and publishing workflows
- Analytics and reporting features
- Integration with the main site's content API

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Database**: Prisma for database operations
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js or similar
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety

## Security Considerations
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Error Handling & Fault Tolerance
- Comprehensive error boundaries for React components
- Graceful fallback handling for API failures
- Retry mechanisms for transient errors
- User-friendly error messages and recovery options
- Logging and monitoring for production debugging

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Security testing for authentication and authorization
- Performance testing for database queries and API responses
- Accessibility testing for admin interface usability

## Development Workflow
- Feature branch development with proper naming
- Pull request templates with required information
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Code coverage reporting and thresholds
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Performance benchmarking and monitoring

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

**Note**: The dashboard runs on port 3001 by default to avoid conflicts with other services in the monorepo. This port configuration is set in the `dev` script in `package.json`.
