  the platform secure across site, dashboard, and docs.

## Release workflow overview

Portfolio OS uses a monorepo-wide release process that keeps apps and packages in sync:

1. **Worktree branches** – Feature teams create dedicated worktrees so long-running efforts stay isolated from `develop`.
2. **Automated checks** – Turbo pipelines run lint, tests, and type-check inside CI before any merge.
3. **Release pull request** – The release captain opens a PR targeting `develop` → `main`, referencing the relevant worktrees.
4. **Docs + changelog update** – Each release must document user-facing changes inside `/docs/releases/*` and link to corresponding PRs or incidents.
5. **Tag & deploy** – Once the PR is approved, the release is tagged (e.g., `v2025.11.15`) and deployed via Vercel + the dashboard’s CI workflow.

Detailed handbooks for every step live in the subpages:

- [Release Guide](/docs/releases/release-guide)
- [Release Workflow](/docs/releases/workflow)
- [Security Overview](/docs/releases/security)
- [Auth Fixes](/docs/releases/auth-fixes)

## Documentation expectations

| Artifact | Owner | Notes |
| -------- | ----- | ----- |
| Changelog entry | Release captain | Should summarize scope, risks, and rollback plan |
| Security review | Platform engineering | Required if dependencies, auth, or infra changed |
| Docs updates | Feature engineer | Update tutorials, references, or screenshots affected by the release |
| Incident follow-up | On-call engineer | Link postmortems for regressions or hotfixes |

Use `/docs/basic-setup/changelog` for user-facing highlights and `/docs/releases` for the canonical engineering record.

## Security posture

- **OWASP alignment** – Dashboard and Site are scanned for the OWASP Top 10 via automated OWASP ZAP jobs in CI.
- **Dependency hygiene** – `pnpm audit` runs nightly. Critical issues trigger PagerDuty and block the next release.
- **Secrets management** – Production secrets live in Vercel / GitHub environments. Local `.env` files are never committed.
- **Authentication** – Prisma migrations touching auth tables must be reviewed by the security owner before merge.

For deep dives, see the [Security Overview](/docs/releases/security) and coordinate with the platform team listed there.

## When things go wrong

- Follow the [Release Workflow](/docs/releases/workflow) rollback steps.
- Document mitigation steps under `/docs/releases/auth-fixes` or create a sibling doc if a new category is needed.
- If the issue affects customers, update `/docs/basic-setup/changelog` and broadcast via the comms checklist in the Release Guide.

Keeping this overview up to date ensures every team member can find the right sub-page during high-pressure incidents.
