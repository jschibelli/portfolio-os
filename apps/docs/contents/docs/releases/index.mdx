## Overview

This section documents how Portfolio OS handles releases, security updates, and authentication-related fixes. It is meant as a hub that links into more detailed guides for day-to-day workflows.

If you only need the step-by-step process, jump straight to the Release Guide. For security posture and hardening guidance, use the Security Overview and Auth Fixes docs.
