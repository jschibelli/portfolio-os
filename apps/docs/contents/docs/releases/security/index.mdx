## Overview

This page provides a **high-level security overview** for Portfolio OS, including:

- Core security principles
- Recommended hardening steps
- Operational checklists for deployments

Use this as a starting point; tailor controls to your actual environment and risk profile.

## Core Security Principles

Portfolio OS is designed around a few key principles:

1. **Least privilege**: Services and users should have only the permissions they absolutely need.
2. **Defense in depth**: Multiple layers of controls (network, application, and data) protect against failures in any single layer.
3. **Secure by default**: Default configuration should be safe for non-production environments and easy to harden for production.
4. **Auditability**: Critical actions should be observable and traceable.

## Hardening Checklist (High Level)

Before treating a deployment as production-ready, ensure you've:

- Enabled **HTTPS everywhere** (behind a TLS-terminating proxy or platform like Vercel).
- Locked down **environment variables** and secrets using a secure secret store.
- Applied **principle of least privilege** to your database user and any API keys.
- Enabled **monitoring and logging** for authentication events and critical API calls.
- Set up **backup and restore** procedures for your database.

## Next Steps

- Review the **Authentication Fixes** and **Release Guide** pages for more operational detail.
- Document environment-specific controls (networking, identity provider, SSO, etc.) in your own runbooks.
