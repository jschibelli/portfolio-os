## Overview

This page documents **common authentication problems** and how to fix them in a Portfolio OS deployment.
It is intentionally high-level so you can adapt it to your actual identity provider and environment.

---

## Common Issues

### 1. Users Cannot Log In

Check the following:

- Environment variables for your auth provider (e.g. OAuth client ID/secret) are set correctly.
- Redirect URLs configured with your provider match your deployed URLs.
- Time on your servers is roughly in sync (JWTs and signed tokens are time-sensitive).

### 2. Session Expiring Too Quickly

- Verify cookie/session configuration in your app (maxAge, secure, sameSite).
- Ensure you are not inadvertently clearing auth cookies on navigation or logout actions.

### 3. Token Validation Errors

- Confirm that the signing keys or JWKs used by your provider match what your app expects.
- For self-hosted auth, rotate secrets carefully and update all dependent services.

## Operational Recommendations

- Enable **structured logging** for auth flows (login, logout, token refresh, errors).
- Monitor failed login attempts and consider basic rate limiting or WAF rules.
- Regularly review and rotate secrets, especially after incidents or personnel changes.

This stub page can be expanded with environment-specific examples and runbooks as your system evolves.
