## Overview

This quick start walks through the minimum steps to publish an article from the docs repo to Hashnode using the automation scripts.

---

## Steps

1. **Add credentials**
   - Create `HASHNODE_TOKEN` and `HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_ID` in `.env.shared`.

2. **Write your article**
   - Create `apps/docs/contents/blog/my-first-post/index.mdx`.
   - Include frontmatter (`title`, `description`, `tags`).

3. **Preview locally**
   ```bash
   pnpm docs:dev
   ```

4. **Publish**
   ```bash
   pnpm scripts hashnode:publish --slug my-first-post
   ```

5. **Verify**
   - Open the Hashnode dashboard → Posts → check the new entry.
   - Ensure the canonical URL points to `/docs/blog/my-first-post`.

You're now synced between Hashnode and the Portfolio OS documentation.
