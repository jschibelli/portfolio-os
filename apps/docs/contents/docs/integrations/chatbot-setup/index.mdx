## Overview

This guide shows how to embed the Portfolio OS chatbot into any site (marketing, docs, landing pages) and connect it to the shared automation services that power analytics, logging, and conversation review.

---

## Prerequisites

1. `OPENAI_API_KEY` stored in the shared `apps/.env.shared` file.
2. `RESEND_API_KEY` for outbound escalations.
3. Access to the Vercel project (or a local environment with `pnpm`).

---

## Installation Steps

1. **Install packages**
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @mindware-blog/site add openai zod
   ```
2. **Sync environment variables**
   ```bash
   pnpm env:sync
   ```
3. **Expose the chatbot component**
   - Import `ChatbotDrawer` from `apps/site/components/chatbot/drawer`.
   - Mount it inside `apps/site/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx`.
4. **Register API route**
   - Ensure `apps/site/app/api/chat/route.ts` is deployed.
   - Verify `Vercel KV` binding exists for rate limiting.

---

## Validation

- Run `pnpm --filter @mindware-blog/site test:chatbot` to execute integration tests.
- Trigger a manual conversation locally and confirm the transcript appears in Supabase.
- Submit a thumbs-down rating to verify the alert lands in Slack.

Once these checks pass, the chatbot is fully integrated and observable across environments.
