## Overview

When new articles land in the docs repo, you can sync them to the production blog (Hashnode) with a single CLI command. This guide covers the update workflow.

---

## When to Run

- After editing an existing article.
- When frontmatter changes (title, tags, canonical URL).
- After backfilling historical posts.

---

## Command

```bash
pnpm scripts hashnode:update --slug &lt;slug>
```

Example:
```bash
pnpm scripts hashnode:update --slug multi-agent-coordination
```

The script diff-checks the local MDX against the remote Hashnode post and updates only the changed fields, preserving stats and comments.

---

## Verification

1. Open the Hashnode dashboard → Posts → select the article.
2. Confirm the updated body and metadata.
3. Check that the canonical URL remains `/docs/blog/&lt;slug>`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **404 slug not found**: ensure the MDX folder name matches the slug.
- **Permission error**: refresh the token in `.env.shared`.
- **No changes detected**: run `git status` to confirm the MDX file actually changed.
