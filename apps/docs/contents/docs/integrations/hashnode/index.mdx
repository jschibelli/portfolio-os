## Overview

Portfolio OS ships a Hashnode integration so long-form articles stay in sync between the docs repo and your developer blog. The integration runs through the automation scripts package and can publish, update, or archive posts programmatically.

---

## Requirements

- Hashnode Personal Access Token with `publication:write` scopes.
- Publication ID (available in the Hashnode dashboard → Settings → API).
- `pnpm` workspace access to `packages/scripts`.

Set both values in `.env.shared`:

```bash
HASHNODE_TOKEN=...
HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_ID=...
```

---

## Publishing Flow

1. Write or update your article in `apps/docs/contents/blog/<slug>/index.mdx`.
2. Run the content build to ensure frontmatter is valid:
   ```bash
   pnpm docs:lint
   ```
3. Execute the publish script:
   ```bash
   pnpm scripts hashnode:publish --slug <slug>
   ```
4. Confirm the post appears on Hashnode with the correct canonical URL pointing back to the docs site.

---

## Updating or Archiving

- `pnpm scripts hashnode:update --slug <slug>`
- `pnpm scripts hashnode:archive --slug <slug>`

Both commands read the existing MDX, apply the changes, and keep the Hashnode draft history intact.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized**: regenerate the token and verify the scopes.
- **Slug mismatch**: ensure the MDX folder name matches the slug you pass to the script.
- **Rate limiting**: the CLI retries automatically with backoff; rerun after a minute if needed.

This integration keeps external content aligned with the documentation repo, so hiring managers can follow canonical references across both surfaces.
