## Overview

The Booking & Scheduling feature turns inbound interest into qualified meetings without manual coordination. It integrates Google Calendar, Google Meet, and timezone logic so visitors can book a slot instantly while I stay focused on delivery work.

---

## Problem Statement

- Contact forms create multi-day back-and-forth to find a mutually available time.
- Timezone mismatches and DST shifts lead to missed or double-booked meetings.
- Manual scheduling interrupts deep work and increases context switching cost.

---

## Solution Summary

| Capability | Detail |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Calendar sync | Real-time availability via Google Calendar free/busy API |
| Meeting creation | Automatic Google Meet links + email confirmations |
| Timezone intelligence | Auto-detect visitor locale with manual override |
| Conflict prevention | Double booking safeguards + race-condition retries |

Implementation lives inside `apps/site/app/(marketing)/book` and `apps/site/lib/calendar`. Tests cover API routes and Playwright flows to keep the automation reliable.

---

## KPIs & Impact

- **Conversion uplift:** Visitors with a booking CTA convert ~3x more often than those funneled to email threads.
- **Time saved:** Each automatically scheduled call saves ~10 minutes of coordination.
- **Global reach:** 24/7 availability regardless of my active timezone or vacation schedule.

## Operating Costs

| Item | Monthly Cost | Notes |
| ---- | ------------ | ----- |
| Google API usage | &lt;$1 | Free tier covers current traffic |
| Hosting | Included | Runs inside the existing Next.js app |
| Maintenance | &lt; 1 hr/month | Mostly verifying OAuth tokens remain valid |

---

## Rollout Checklist

1. Configure Google service account secrets in `apps/site/.env.local`.
2. Verify `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` matches the calendar that holds real availability.
3. Run `pnpm --filter @mindware-blog/site test:functional` to confirm the full journey.
4. Enable the booking CTA on the homepage or relevant project page.

This business case demonstrates how automation unlocks international availability, reduces friction, and showcases pragmatic systems thinking.
