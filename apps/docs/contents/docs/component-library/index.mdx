## Why it exists

Portfolio OS ships a single Storybook workspace that showcases every reusable component from `packages/ui`, `apps/site`, and `apps/dashboard`. The goal is to give product, design, and engineering a canonical view of:

- Supported variants, states, and accessibility notes for each component
- Match between design tokens (`apps/docs/styles/globals.css`) and UI implementations
- Ready-to-copy code snippets so engineers can drop a component into any front-end surface

The Storybook docs live at [/docs/component-library/storybook](/docs/component-library/storybook) and publish to the hosted Storybook instance linked from the main navigation.

## How the workspace is structured

1. **Foundations** – Typography, spacing, color, and interactive primitives. These map to the Design System page and should be updated first whenever tokens change.
2. **Core components** – Buttons, cards, nav items, data tables, banners, etc. Each story exports both a Canvas demo and an MDX-based usage guide.
3. **Application flows** – Higher-level compositions (e.g., Gallery grid, AI assistant prompt list) that document required data contracts.

When you add a new component:

```text
packages/ui/src/components/NewComponent.tsx
apps/site/components/NewComponent.stories.tsx
apps/docs/contents/docs/component-library/storybook/index.mdx
```

- Keep the component props typed with `ComponentPropsWithoutRef` so stories and docs can infer prop tables.
- Use the shared `cn` utility for conditional class names to stay consistent with Tailwind conventions.

## Governance checklist

- **Accessibility** – Every story must include keyboard navigation notes and aria attributes when applicable.
- **Visual regression baseline** – Run `pnpm test-storybook` (Playwright) whenever you add or refactor a component. Attach the diff to the PR.
- **Docs sync** – Update both this overview page and the detailed [Storybook guide](/docs/component-library/storybook) if you change folder structure, naming, or publishing steps.
- **Cross-app parity** – Dashboard and Site consume the same packages. If you ship a component to one surface, list any app-specific overrides inside the Storybook notes.
