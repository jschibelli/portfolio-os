## Overview

The component library collects reusable UI components used across the Portfolio OS site, docs, and dashboard. It is the single source of truth for buttons, forms, overlays, and other primitives so that product surfaces stay visually and behaviorally consistent.

Use this page as the launchpad into more detailed component docs and Storybook stories.

## Storybook

The primary way to explore components is via Storybook.

- Browse interactive examples
- Inspect props, states, and edge cases
- Validate accessibility behaviors (focus, keyboard, ARIA)

Visit the dedicated Storybook docs for details on how stories are structured and how to add new ones:
