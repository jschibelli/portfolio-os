description: Comprehensive guide for developers working on Portfolio OS
---

Welcome to the Portfolio OS Developer Guide. This comprehensive resource covers everything you need to know to contribute effectively to the project.

## Overview

Portfolio OS is a modern, production-grade monorepo built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Turborepo. It powers a complete portfolio ecosystem including a public site, admin dashboard, and shared component libraries.

<Note type="success">
This guide assumes you've completed the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) section and have a working development environment.

## Core Principles

Portfolio OS follows these development principles:

### 1. Type Safety First

- Strict TypeScript configuration across all packages
- No `any` types without explicit justification
- Comprehensive type coverage for API responses

### 2. Component Reusability

- Shared UI components in `packages/ui`
- Business logic in `packages/lib`
- Utilities in `packages/utils`

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Server Components by default
- Strategic client-side rendering
- Redis caching for expensive operations
- Image optimization with Next.js Image

### 4. Developer Experience

- Fast development with Turbo
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Comprehensive error messages
- Automated code quality checks

### 5. Automation

- PowerShell scripts for common tasks
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Automated PR management
- Multi-agent development support

## Development Commands Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm dev` | Start all apps in development mode |
| `pnpm dev --filter=@mindware-blog/site` | Start only the site app |
| `pnpm build` | Build all packages and apps |
| `pnpm lint` | Run ESLint across workspace |
| `pnpm test` | Run all test suites |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type check all TypeScript code |
| `pnpm format` | Format code with Prettier |

## Working with the Monorepo

### Understanding Turborepo

Turborepo orchestrates builds and tests across the monorepo:

- **Caching**: Build outputs are cached for speed
- **Parallelization**: Tasks run in parallel when possible
- **Dependencies**: Automatically builds dependencies first

### PNPM Workspaces

Packages are linked using PNPM workspaces:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@mindware-blog/ui": "workspace:*",
    "@mindware-blog/lib": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

The `workspace:*` protocol links to the local package.

## Best Practices

<Note type="warning">
**Critical Guidelines:**

1. Always run tests before submitting PRs
2. Follow the commit convention (see [Workflow](/docs/developer-guide/workflow))
3. Update documentation when adding features
4. Review TypeScript errors - don't ignore them
5. Test both site and dashboard apps when changing shared packages
</Note>

## Testing & Quality Gates

- Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and any relevant `pnpm test --filter=<package>` commands before opening a PR.
- Follow the [Testing Strategy](/docs/testing/overview) to understand which suites cover API routes, UI flows, and end-to-end scenarios.
- Capture manual testing notes in the PR description, including environment variables or feature flags used.

## Version Control & Reviews

- Use the conventional commit format described in [Development Workflow](/docs/developer-guide/workflow#commit-conventions).
- Reference related issues in PR descriptions and docs updates to maintain traceability.
- Respond to code review feedback promptly; push follow-up commits that directly address reviewer comments and note the resolution in the PR thread.
