  <Card href="/docs/apps-packages/site" title="Portfolio Site" description="Public-facing portfolio, blog, and projects showcase" />
  <Card href="/docs/apps-packages/dashboard" title="Admin Dashboard" description="Content management and analytics dashboard" />
  <Card href="/docs/developer-guide/packages" title="Shared Packages" description="Reusable UI components, utilities, and integrations" />
</CardGrid>

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **PNPM** package manager ([Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation))
- **Git** for version control
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

<Note>
Already have the prerequisites? Skip to [Installation Steps](#installation-steps) below.
</Note>

## Installation Steps

<Step>
  <StepItem title="Clone the Repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jschibelli/portfolio-os.git
    cd portfolio-os
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Install Dependencies">
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
    This will install all packages across the monorepo using PNPM workspaces.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Setup Environment Variables">
    ```bash
    # Copy environment templates
    cp apps/site/.env.example apps/site/.env.local
    cp apps/dashboard/.env.example apps/dashboard/.env.local
    ```
    Edit the `.env.local` files with your API keys. See [Environment Configuration](/docs/getting-started/environment) for details.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Generate Prisma Client">
    ```bash
    cd apps/dashboard
    pnpm prisma generate
    cd ../..
    ```
    This generates the TypeScript types for database access in the dashboard.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Start Development Servers">
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    Both apps will start in parallel:
    - **Site**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    - **Dashboard**: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
  </StepItem>
</Step>

<Note type="success">
ðŸŽ‰ **Success!** Your Portfolio OS development environment is ready. Open your browser to see the apps running.
