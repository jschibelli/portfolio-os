## Overview

Run your first Portfolio OS automation script in under 10 minutes

## Your First Automation Script

This guide walks you through running your first Portfolio OS automation script on your machine.
You'll verify your environment, clone the repo (if needed), and run a safe, read-only analysis
of GitHub issues.

<Note type="success">
**Time required:** ~10 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** PowerShell 7+, GitHub CLI (`gh`), access to the `portfolio-os` repository
</Note>

---

## Quick Start Steps

<Step>
  <StepItem title="Check Your Environment">
    Open a terminal and verify these tools:

```powershell
# PowerShell version (need 7+)
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion

# GitHub CLI
gh --version

# Git
git --version
```

If `gh` is not authenticated:

```powershell
gh auth login
gh auth status
```

Follow the prompts and choose HTTPS + browser login for GitHub.com.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Clone and Navigate to the Project">

If you haven’t already cloned the repo:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/jschibelli/portfolio-os.git
cd portfolio-os
```

If you already have it on disk, just navigate to it:

```powershell
cd path/to/portfolio-os
```

All the automation scripts live in the top-level `scripts/` directory.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Explore the Issue Management Scripts">
    The Issue Management scripts are a safe, friendly place to start:

```powershell
cd scripts/issue-management

Get-ChildItem
```

You should see subfolders like:

```text
analysis/
configuration/
implementation/
management/
```

We'll use an analysis script in **dry run** mode so you can see what it would do without
changing anything.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Run Your First Script (Dry Run)">

From the `scripts/issue-management` directory, run:

```powershell
.\analysis\analyze-issues.ps1 -DryRun
```

This command:

- Connects to GitHub via `gh`
- Fetches issue data for the configured project
- Prints an analysis plan and summary to the console  
  (instead of making any changes)

### What You Should See

Exact output will vary, but you should expect:

- A confirmation that GitHub authentication is working  
- A list or summary of issues being analyzed  
- Notes about potential priorities, sizes, or patterns

If something fails, check the **Common Issues** section below.
  </StepItem>
</Step>

## Next Steps: Beyond Hello World

Once the dry run works, here are natural next steps:

- **Run a more focused analysis**

  ```powershell
  # Analyze a specific issue (replace 250 with a real issue number)
  .\analysis\analyze-issues.ps1 -IssueNumber 250 -GeneratePlan
  ```

- **Auto-configure an issue (preview only)**

  ```powershell
  .\configuration\configure-issue-auto.ps1 `
    -IssueNumber 250 `
    -DryRun
  ```

- **Explore other script categories**
  - `scripts/pr-management` – PR automation and quality checks  
  - `scripts/agent-management` – Multi-agent development workflows  
  - `scripts/core-utilities` – Shared utilities and integrations  

Use `Get-Help .\script-name.ps1 -Full` to discover parameters and examples for any script.

## Common Issues

### "File cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled"

On Windows, PowerShell may block script execution by default.

**Symptoms:**

```text
File cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled
```

**Fix:**

Run this once in an elevated PowerShell (or in your user session if allowed):

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
```

Then re-run the script.

---

### "gh: command not found" or authentication errors

**Symptoms:**

- `gh: command not found`
- Errors about unauthorized or missing scopes

**Fix:**

1. Install GitHub CLI from the official site if it’s missing.  
2. Authenticate:

```powershell
gh auth login
gh auth status
```

Make sure the account you’re using has access to the `portfolio-os` repository.

---

### "Issue not found" or no issues returned

If `-IssueNumber` is invalid or you’re working in a fork where the issue doesn’t exist,
you may see errors or empty output.

**Checks:**

- Verify the issue number exists in the repository.  
- If you are in a fork, make sure the scripts are configured to point at the right owner/repo.
