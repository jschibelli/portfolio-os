## Overview

The design system codifies colors, spacing, typography, and interaction patterns shared across the docs, site, and dashboard apps. It is implemented in Tailwind (docs) and CSS variables (site/dashboard) so UI teams can ship consistently without rewriting tokens per surface.

---

## Tokens

Design tokens live inside `apps/docs/styles/globals.css` and `packages/ui/tailwind.config.js`. They expose semantic names instead of hex values:

- `--color-background`, `--color-card`, `--color-ring`
- `--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`, `--radius-lg`
- `--color-sidebar-*` for navigation chrome

Use semantic tokens inside components instead of hard-coded colors to keep dark mode parity.

---

## Typography

`Inter` is the primary font across apps. In docs, typography is wrapped with the shared `Typography` component which applies prose styles, list markers, and code block formatting. For site/dashboard surfaces, typography utilities live in `packages/ui` and map to Tailwind presets.

| Use Case | Utility | Notes |
| -------- | ------- | ----- |
| Page titles | `text-3xl font-semibold` | Mirror docs `<h1>` styling |
| Section headings | `text-xl font-semibold` | Align with `## Overview` sections |
| Body text | `text-sm text-muted-foreground` | Ensures contrast in both themes |

---

## Interaction & Components

- Radix primitives ensure accessible dialogs, sheets, and dropdowns.
- `class-variance-authority` enforces consistent variant naming (e.g., `variant="primary"` vs `size="lg"`).
- Hover/focus states should use `ring` utilities and `transition` helpers for smooth feedback.

When introducing a new component, update:

1. The component implementation (`packages/ui` or app-specific directory)
2. Storybook story (`apps/site/components/**/Component.stories.tsx`)
3. Documentation entry (usually `docs/component-library`)

## Resources

- [Components & Patterns](/docs/developer-guide/components)
- [Storybook Component Library](/docs/component-library/storybook)
- [Typography + tokens source (`globals.css`)](https://github.com/jschibelli/portfolio-os/blob/main/apps/docs/styles/globals.css)

This shared system allows design updates (colors, typography, spacing) to propagate instantly to every app without manual refactors.
