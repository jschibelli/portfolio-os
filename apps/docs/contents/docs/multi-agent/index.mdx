# Multi-Agent System

Portfolio OS includes a sophisticated multi-agent development system that enables parallel development by multiple AI agents working simultaneously on different features.

## Overview

The multi-agent system uses Git worktrees to create isolated development environments where each agent can work independently without conflicts. This dramatically accelerates development by allowing multiple features to be built in parallel.

## Key Benefits

- **Parallel Development**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on different features
- **Zero Conflicts**: Each agent has its own isolated workspace
- **Easy Integration**: Merge completed work through standard PR process
- **State Management**: Track agent status and task assignments
- **Coordination**: PowerShell scripts orchestrate agent workflows

## How It Works

<Mermaid chart={`graph TB
    Main[Main Repository] --> Agent1[Agent 1 Worktree]
    Main --> Agent2[Agent 2 Worktree]
    Main --> Agent3[Agent 3 Worktree]
    
    Agent1 --> Feature1[Feature A]
    Agent2 --> Feature2[Feature B]
    Agent3 --> Feature3[Feature C]
    
    Feature1 --> PR1[PR #123]
    Feature2 --> PR2[PR #124]
    Feature3 --> PR3[PR #125]
    
    PR1 --> Develop[Develop Branch]
    PR2 --> Develop
    PR3 --> Develop`} />

## Core Components

### 1. Git Worktrees

Git worktrees create separate working directories that share the same repository:

```bash
# Main repo
portfolio-os/

# Agent worktrees
worktrees/agent-1-chris/
worktrees/agent-2-jason/
worktrees/agent-3-alex/
```

Each worktree is a full working copy with its own branch.

### 2. Agent Coordination Scripts

PowerShell scripts in `scripts/agent-management/`:

- **setup-agent-development.ps1** - Create new agent worktree
- **manage-multi-agent-system.ps1** - Coordinate multiple agents
- **start-multi-agent-e2e-unified.ps1** - Run complete workflows
- **update-agent-status.ps1** - Track agent progress

### 3. Task Assignment

Agents are assigned specific tasks with clear boundaries:

```json
{
  "agent-1": {
    "name": "Chris",
    "role": "Frontend Specialist",
    "tasks": ["Issue #266", "Issue #268"],
    "branch": "chris-automation-frontend"
  },
  "agent-2": {
    "name": "Jason", 
    "role": "Backend Specialist",
    "tasks": ["Issue #264", "Issue #265"],
    "branch": "jason-automation-backend"
  }
}
```

### 4. State Synchronization

Configuration file tracks agent state:

- Current branch
- Assigned tasks
- Work status (pending, in-progress, review, completed)
- Dependencies

## Typical Workflow

<Step>
  <StepItem title="Create Agent Worktrees">
    ```powershell
    .\scripts\agent-management\setup-agent-development.ps1 -AgentName "agent-1"
    .\scripts\agent-management\setup-agent-development.ps1 -AgentName "agent-2"
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Assign Tasks to Agents">
    Each agent receives specific issues or features to implement.
    
    Tasks are tracked in `scripts/configuration/agent-assignment-config.json`
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Agents Work in Parallel">
    Each agent:
    - Works in their isolated worktree
    - Makes commits on their feature branch
    - Has no conflicts with other agents
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Create Pull Requests">
    ```powershell
    # Agent 1 completes work
    .\scripts\pr-management\automate-pr-unified.ps1 -Title "feat: implement feature A"
    
    # Agent 2 completes work
    .\scripts\pr-management\automate-pr-unified.ps1 -Title "feat: implement feature B"
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Review and Merge">
    PRs are reviewed and merged to `develop` branch independently.
  </StepItem>
</Step>

## Use Cases

### Parallel Feature Development

Two agents implement different features simultaneously:
- Agent 1: User authentication system
- Agent 2: Dashboard analytics

### Bug Fixes + Features

Mix urgent fixes with feature work:
- Agent 1: Critical security patch
- Agent 2: New feature development

### Experimentation

Try different approaches in parallel:
- Agent 1: Implement solution A
- Agent 2: Implement solution B
- Compare and choose the best approach

## Best Practices

<Note type="success">
**Tips for Effective Multi-Agent Development:**

1. **Clear task boundaries** - Minimize overlap between agents
2. **Regular syncing** - Keep worktrees updated with develop
3. **Status tracking** - Update agent status regularly
4. **Communication** - Document decisions in PRs
5. **Small PRs** - Easier to review and merge
</Note>

## Limitations

<Note type="warning">
Be aware of these constraints:

- **Disk space**: Each worktree is a full copy (~100MB each)
- **Coordination overhead**: More agents = more coordination needed
- **Merge conflicts**: Can still occur if agents touch same files
- **Resource usage**: Multiple Node processes if running dev servers
</Note>
