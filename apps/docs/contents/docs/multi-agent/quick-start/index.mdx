# Multi-Agent Quick Start

Set up and run your first multi-agent workflow in just 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [x] Portfolio OS installed and working
- [x] PowerShell 7+ installed
- [x] Git worktree feature available (Git 2.5+)
- [x] At least 2GB free disk space

## Quick Setup

<Step>
  <StepItem title="Create Your First Agent">
    ```powershell
    cd portfolio-os
    .\scripts\agent-management\setup-agent-development.ps1 -AgentName "agent-1"
    ```
    
    This creates a new worktree at `worktrees/agent-1/`
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Verify Agent Created">
    ```powershell
    # List all worktrees
    git worktree list
    
    # Check agent directory
    ls worktrees/
    ```
    
    You should see the new agent worktree listed.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Assign a Task">
    Edit `scripts/configuration/agent-assignment-config.json`:
    
    ```json
    {
      "agents": [{
        "name": "agent-1",
        "tasks": ["Implement dark mode toggle"],
        "branch": "feature/dark-mode",
        "status": "in-progress"
      }]
    }
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Agent Starts Working">
    The agent now works in their isolated worktree:
    
    ```powershell
    cd worktrees/agent-1
    pnpm dev
    # Make changes, commit, create PR
    ```
  </StepItem>
</Step>

## Multi-Agent Workflow

Now let's run multiple agents in parallel:

<Step>
  <StepItem title="Create Multiple Agents">
    ```powershell
    .\scripts\agent-management\start-multi-agent-e2e-unified.ps1 `
      -NumAgents 2 `
      -Tasks "Add authentication", "Create admin dashboard"
    ```
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Monitor Agent Status">
    ```powershell
    .\scripts\agent-management\manage-multi-agent-system.ps1 -Action status
    ```
    
    Shows current status of all agents.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Agents Work in Parallel">
    - Agent 1 implements authentication in `worktrees/agent-1/`
    - Agent 2 builds admin dashboard in `worktrees/agent-2/`
    - No conflicts because they're in separate worktrees!
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Create PRs">
    ```powershell
    # Agent 1 completes work
    cd worktrees/agent-1
    .\scripts\pr-management\automate-pr-unified.ps1 `
      -Title "feat: add user authentication" `
      -Body "Implements JWT-based auth"
    
    # Agent 2 completes work
    cd worktrees/agent-2
    .\scripts\pr-management\automate-pr-unified.ps1 `
      -Title "feat: create admin dashboard" `
      -Body "Adds admin UI with analytics"
    ```
  </StepItem>
</Step>

## Example: Parallel Feature Development

Let's walk through a real example:

### Scenario

Build two features simultaneously:
- **Feature A**: Blog comment system (Agent 1)
- **Feature B**: Newsletter subscription (Agent 2)

### Implementation

```powershell
# Setup
.\scripts\agent-management\setup-agent-development.ps1 -AgentName "agent-1"
.\scripts\agent-management\setup-agent-development.ps1 -AgentName "agent-2"

# Agent 1: Comment System
cd worktrees/agent-1
git checkout -b feature/comments
# Implement comment system
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add blog comments"
git push origin feature/comments

# Agent 2: Newsletter
cd worktrees/agent-2
git checkout -b feature/newsletter
# Implement newsletter
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add newsletter subscription"
git push origin feature/newsletter

# Create PRs (both at the same time!)
```

Both features developed in parallel, zero conflicts!

## Common Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `setup-agent-development.ps1` | Create new agent |
| `manage-multi-agent-system.ps1 -Action status` | Check all agents |
| `update-agent-status.ps1` | Update agent progress |
| `git worktree list` | List all worktrees |
| `git worktree remove <path>` | Delete worktree |

## Troubleshooting

### Worktree Creation Fails

```powershell
# Error: worktree already exists
Solution: Remove existing worktree first
git worktree remove worktrees/agent-1

# Error: branch already exists
Solution: Use different branch name
git checkout -b feature/different-name
```

### Agent Can't Push

```powershell
# Error: permission denied
Solution: Ensure Git credentials are configured
git config --global credential.helper store
```

### Port Conflicts

```powershell
# Error: port 3000 in use
Solution: Each agent should use different port
# In worktrees/agent-1/apps/site/next.config.js
module.exports = {
  devServer: { port: 3001 }
}
```

## Best Practices

<Note type="success">
**Tips for Success:**

1. **Clear boundaries**: Assign non-overlapping features
2. **Small tasks**: Each agent works on focused features
3. **Regular syncs**: Rebase on develop frequently
4. **Status updates**: Keep agent status current
5. **Clean up**: Remove unused worktrees
</Note>
