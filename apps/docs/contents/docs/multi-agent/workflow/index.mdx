## Automated Workflow System

### Complete E2E Automation

The workflow automation system provides end-to-end orchestration that:

1. **Initializes** agent worktrees with proper isolation
2. **Assigns** tasks based on agent specialization
3. **Monitors** progress and health continuously
4. **Generates** pull requests when work completes
5. **Validates** quality through automated checks
6. **Notifies** stakeholders of completion and status

### Step-by-Step Workflow

<Step>
  <StepItem title="Initialize Agents">
    The system creates multiple isolated agent worktrees:
    - Each agent receives a dedicated workspace
    - Workspaces are initialized from the main development branch
    - Dependencies and configurations are set up automatically
    - Agents are ready to begin work independently
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Assign Tasks">
    Tasks are distributed based on agent specialization:
    - Frontend tasks go to frontend-specialized agents
    - Backend work is assigned to backend-specialized agents
    - Task assignments are tracked in configuration
    - Dependencies and priorities are established
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Monitor Progress">
    The coordination layer continuously monitors agent activity:
    - Regular status checks track work progress
    - Health monitoring ensures agents are functioning
    - Blockers and issues are identified proactively
    - Stakeholders receive progress updates
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Auto-Create PRs">
    Pull requests are automatically generated when work completes:
    - Changes are packaged with appropriate metadata
    - PR descriptions include context and testing notes
    - Reviewers are assigned based on expertise
    - CI/CD pipelines are triggered automatically
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Quality Checks">
    Automated quality validation ensures standards are met:
    - Code quality metrics are evaluated
    - Test coverage is verified
    - Security scans are performed
    - Performance implications are assessed
  </StepItem>
</Step>

2. **Monitor closely**: Watch first few runs
3. **Gradual automation**: Add automation incrementally
4. **Error handling**: Plan for failures
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive logs for debugging
6. **Testing**: Test workflows in staging first
