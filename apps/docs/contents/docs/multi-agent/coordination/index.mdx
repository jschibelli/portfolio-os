## Overview

Strategies for coordinating multiple agents effectively

Learn how to effectively coordinate multiple AI agents working in parallel.

## Coordination Strategies

### Task Assignment Strategies

#### 1. By Feature Boundaries

Assign complete features to agents:

```json
{
  "agent-1": ["User Authentication System"],
  "agent-2": ["Blog Comment System"],
  "agent-3": ["Analytics Dashboard"]
}
```

**Pros**: Clear ownership, minimal conflicts
**Cons**: Uneven workload

#### 2. By Component Layer

Divide by architectural layer:

```json
{
  "agent-1": ["Frontend Components"],
  "agent-2": ["API Routes"],
  "agent-3": ["Database Schema"]
}
```

**Pros**: Specialized work
**Cons**: Requires coordination for integration

#### 3. By Priority

Assign by urgency:

```json
{
  "agent-1": ["Critical Bug Fixes"],
  "agent-2": ["High Priority Features"],
  "agent-3": ["Nice-to-Have Enhancements"]
}
```

**Pros**: Focuses on important work
**Cons**: May cause conflicts if priorities overlap

## Coordination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Independent Parallel

Agents work on completely separate features.

    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    section Agent 1
    Feature A :a1, 2025-10-01, 3d
    section Agent 2
    Feature B :a2, 2025-10-01, 3d
    section Agent 3
    Feature C :a3, 2025-10-01, 3d`} />

**Use when**: Features are completely independent

### Pattern 2: Sequential Handoff

One agent completes work before next begins.

<Mermaid chart={`gantt
    title Sequential Handoff
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    section Agent 1
    API Design :a1, 2025-10-01, 2d
    section Agent 2
    Frontend Integration :after a1, 2d
    section Agent 3
    Testing & Polish :after a2, 2d`} />

**Use when**: Work has dependencies

### Pattern 3: Parallel with Sync Points

Agents sync periodically.

<Mermaid chart={`gantt
    title Parallel with Sync
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    section Agent 1
    Component A :a1, 2025-10-01, 2d
    Sync :milestone, m1, after a1, 0d
    Integrate :a1b, after m1, 1d
    section Agent 2
    Component B :a2, 2025-10-01, 2d
    Sync :milestone, m2, after a2, 0d
    Integrate :a2b, after m2, 1d`} />

**Use when**: Features need periodic integration

## Communication Protocols

### Status Updates

The coordination layer maintains real-time status tracking:

**Status Information**
- Current work phase (not started, in progress, review, completed)
- Progress indicators and completion percentage
- Active tasks and priorities
- Notes and context about current work state

### Dependency Declaration

Dependencies are explicitly tracked to coordinate work:

**Dependency Types**
- **Depends On**: Work that must complete before this task can proceed
- **Blocks**: Work that is waiting for this task to complete
- **Related**: Work that shares common interfaces or contracts

This enables intelligent scheduling and prevents agents from being blocked unnecessarily.

### Conflict Prevention

Strategies to prevent conflicts:

1. **File ownership**: Assign specific files to agents
2. **Module boundaries**: Work in different packages
3. **Regular rebasing**: Sync with develop frequently
4. **Communication**: Discuss overlapping work

## Coordination Tools

### Configuration Management

The system maintains structured configuration for coordination:

**Agent Assignment Configuration** tracks:
- Agent identity and specialization
- Current task assignments
- Work status and progress
- Dependencies and blockers
- Branch and workspace information

**Coordination Settings** define:
- Synchronization frequency
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Integration order and priorities
- Communication protocols

### State Management

**Workspace State Tracking** monitors:
- Last synchronization timestamps
- Commit relationships with main branch
- Uncommitted changes detection
- Rebase and integration status

**Health Monitoring** provides:
- Real-time agent status overview
- Workspace synchronization status
- Conflict detection and alerts
- Integration readiness indicators

## Handling Conflicts

### When Conflicts Occur

<Step>
  <StepItem title="Detection">
    The system automatically detects potential conflicts during synchronization operations, analyzing file changes and merge scenarios.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Notification">
    Stakeholders are immediately alerted with details about the conflict, including affected files and the agents involved.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Analysis">
    The system provides analysis of:
    - Overlapping file changes
    - Nature and extent of conflicts
    - Potential resolution strategies
    - Impact assessment
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Resolution">
    Conflicts are resolved through established strategies:
    - Coordinated manual resolution when needed
    - Priority-based change selection
    - Integrated merge with adjustments
    - Stakeholder decision support
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Verification">
    Comprehensive validation ensures the resolution is correct through automated testing and quality checks.
  </StepItem>
</Step>

### Conflict Prevention Strategies

1. **Proactive sync**: Rebase on develop daily
2. **File locking**: Declare file ownership
3. **Communication**: Discuss potential overlaps
4. **Small PRs**: Merge frequently, reduce conflict window
5. **Module isolation**: Work in separate packages

## Monitoring & Metrics

The system tracks coordination effectiveness through key metrics:

| Metric | Target | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Agent utilization | >80% | Time spent on active work |
| Conflict rate | &lt;5% | PRs with merge conflicts |
| Average PR size | &lt;300 lines | Smaller = easier to review |
| Time to merge | &lt;24 hours | Speed of integration |
| Rebase frequency | Daily | How often synced with develop |

These metrics provide insight into system efficiency and help identify opportunities for optimization.

## Best Practices

<Note type="success">
**Coordination Best Practices:**

1. **Daily standups**: Review agent status
2. **Clear assignments**: No ambiguity in tasks
3. **Dependency tracking**: Document dependencies
4. **Regular syncs**: Rebase on develop daily
5. **Small iterations**: Merge work frequently
6. **Communication**: Over-communicate potential conflicts
</Note>

## Advanced Patterns

### Dynamic Task Assignment

The system can automatically assign tasks based on:
- Agent specialization and skills
- Current workload and capacity
- Task complexity and priority
- Historical performance data

### Load Balancing

Work distribution is optimized through:
- Real-time capacity monitoring
- Even distribution across available agents
- Skill-appropriate task matching
- Dynamic rebalancing as needed

### Priority Queue

High-priority work is handled through:
- Urgent task identification
- Intelligent agent selection
- Capacity preemption when needed
- Expedited workflow processing
