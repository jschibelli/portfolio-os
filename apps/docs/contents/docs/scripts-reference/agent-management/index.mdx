## Overview

Multi-agent development system scripts for worktrees, coordination, and workflows

The Agent Management scripts implement the multi-agent development model used in Portfolio OS.
They create and manage isolated worktrees for each agent, coordinate assignments, and orchestrate
end-to-end workflows across multiple agents.

<Note type="info">
These scripts live under `scripts/agent-management/` and are best understood alongside the
conceptual docs in **Multi-Agent System → Quick Start & Architecture**.

```

### Prerequisites

- **PowerShell 7+**
- Git installed and configured
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) configured for the repository (for project/issue integration)

## `setup-agent-development.ps1`

**Path**: `scripts/agent-management/setup-agent-development.ps1`  
**Purpose**: One-time or occasional setup of agent worktrees for multi-agent development.

### Capabilities

- Create isolated Git worktrees per agent (e.g., `agent-1`, `agent-2`)
- Ensure each agent has a clean working directory and consistent base branch

### Key Parameters

| Parameter    | Type   | Required | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `-AgentName`| string | Yes      | Agent identifier, e.g. `"agent-1"`              |
| `-Branch`   | string | No       | Base branch for the worktree (default `develop`)|

### Usage Example

```powershell
# Create a worktree for agent-1
.\scripts\agent-management\setup-agent-development.ps1 -AgentName "agent-1"
```

---

## `manage-multi-agent-system.ps1`

**Path**: `scripts/agent-management/manage-multi-agent-system.ps1`  
**Purpose**: Core control surface for the multi-agent development system.

### Operations

Depending on the script implementation, common operations include:

- `setup` – Initialize the multi-agent system
- `create` – Create additional agent worktrees
- `destroy` – Remove agent worktrees when no longer needed
- `list` – Show current agents, branches, and status
- `assign` – Assign issues or PRs to specific agents
- `sync` – Synchronize worktrees with the main branch
- `status` – Show system/agent health
- `cleanup` – Clean up stale branches or worktrees

### Usage Examples

```powershell
# List current agents and their worktrees
.\scripts\agent-management\manage-multi-agent-system.ps1 -Action list
```

```powershell
# Synchronize all agent worktrees with the main development branch
.\scripts\agent-management\manage-multi-agent-system.ps1 -Action sync
```

```powershell
# Assign an issue to a particular agent (if supported)
.\scripts\agent-management\manage-multi-agent-system.ps1 `
  -Action assign `
  -AgentName "agent-1" `
  -IssueNumber 250
```

Consult `Get-Help .\manage-multi-agent-system.ps1 -Full` for the exact action and parameter set.

## `manage-agent-coordination-unified.ps1`

**Path**: `scripts/agent-management/manage-agent-coordination-unified.ps1`  
**Purpose**: Central coordination and command helper for multi-agent workflows.

### Capabilities

- Show agent-specific commands and helpful summaries
- Report branch status and sync status per agent
- Generate suggested commands for syncing or switching worktrees
- Provide a consolidated status view of all agents

### Typical Usage

```powershell
# Get a high-level view of all agents and recommended commands
.\scripts\agent-management\manage-agent-coordination-unified.ps1
```

Use this script as your “command center” when operating multiple agents in parallel.

---

## `manage-worktree-operations-unified.ps1`

**Path**: `scripts/agent-management/manage-worktree-operations-unified.ps1`  
**Purpose**: Unified interface for creating, switching, and managing agent worktrees.

### Capabilities

- Create new worktrees for agents
- Switch the current working directory to a specific agent’s worktree
- Map issues to agents and associated branches
- Run batch operations over multiple worktrees

### Example Usage

```powershell
# Switch to the worktree for agent-2
.\scripts\agent-management\manage-worktree-operations-unified.ps1 `
  -Action switch `
  -AgentName "agent-2"
```

```powershell
# Create a new agent worktree and link it to an issue
.\scripts\agent-management\manage-worktree-operations-unified.ps1 `
  -Action create `
  -AgentName "agent-3" `
  -IssueNumber 260
```

---

## `start-multi-agent-e2e-unified.ps1`

**Path**: `scripts/agent-management/start-multi-agent-e2e-unified.ps1`  
**Purpose**: Orchestrate end-to-end multi-agent workflows across multiple issues or tasks.

### Capabilities

- Coordinate parallel development across multiple agents
- Provide different execution modes (continuous, batch, monitor) depending on script design
- Connect issues → branches → PRs as part of a unified flow

### Typical Parameters

Exact parameters may vary; common ones include:

| Parameter    | Type   | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `-NumAgents`| int    | Number of agents participating                   |
| `-Tasks`    | array  | Optional list of task descriptions               |
| `-Mode`     | string | Execution mode (e.g. `continuous`, `monitor`)    |

### Usage Example

```powershell
# Start a two-agent E2E workflow with descriptive task names
.\scripts\agent-management\start-multi-agent-e2e-unified.ps1 `
  -NumAgents 2 `
  -Tasks "Implement feature A", "Implement feature B"
```

---

## `update-agent-status.ps1`

**Path**: `scripts/agent-management/update-agent-status.ps1`  
**Purpose**: Update and report agent status information (e.g. active tasks, progress).

### Example Usage

```powershell
# Mark an agent as in progress on a set of issues
.\scripts\agent-management\update-agent-status.ps1 `
  -AgentName "agent-1" `
  -Status "In progress"
```

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Initial Setup** – Run `setup-agent-development.ps1` to create agent worktrees.  
2. **System Management** – Use `manage-multi-agent-system.ps1` to manage agents and sync branches.  
3. **Coordination** – Use `manage-agent-coordination-unified.ps1` as a dashboard for commands and status.  
4. **Worktree Operations** – Use `manage-worktree-operations-unified.ps1` to switch or create worktrees.  
5. **End-to-End Runs** – Use `start-multi-agent-e2e-unified.ps1` for full multi-agent workflows.  
6. **Status Updates** – Use `update-agent-status.ps1` to keep status in sync with project tracking.

## Troubleshooting & Further Reading

- If Git operations fail, verify that your local Git configuration and remotes match the
  expected `origin` for Portfolio OS.
- For conflicts or branch issues, synchronize with the main branch before re-running E2E
  workflows.
