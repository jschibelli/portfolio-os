## Overview

GitHub issue automation scripts for analysis, configuration, and implementation

The Issue Management scripts automate the full lifecycle of GitHub issues in Portfolio OS:
from analysis and configuration, to implementation workflow and queue management.

<Note type="info">
All scripts live under `scripts/issue-management/` and are organized into **analysis**,
**configuration**, **implementation**, and **management** subfolders.
</Note>

## Common Dependencies & Configuration

These scripts depend on:

- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** for retrieving and updating issues and project fields
- Portfolio OS project configuration, including:
  - Default **project ID**
  - **Base branch** (typically `develop`)
  - Default owner / user for operations

Configuration values are documented in the script README and can be overridden via
environment variables or script parameters where supported.

---

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- **Script cannot run due to execution policy**  
  - On Windows, you may need to enable script execution:
  - `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`

- **Issue fields not updating**  
  - Confirm `gh auth status` is successful for the right GitHub account.  
  - Verify that the project, field IDs, and repository match your environment.

- **No issues appear in the pipeline**  
  - Check that issues are in a status/state expected by the pipeline logic.  
  - Use analysis scripts to inspect the backlog and confirm filters.

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Analyze** using `analyze-issues.ps1` and/or `analyze-stale-issues.ps1`.  
2. **Configure** new and existing issues using `configure-issue-auto.ps1` or `configure-issues-unified.ps1`.  
3. **Implement** with `implement-issues.ps1` for targeted work.  
4. **Automate** ongoing processing via `manage-issue-queue.ps1` and `run-issue-pipeline.ps1`.
