# Automation Prompt Library Audit

_Generated: 2025-11-15_

This report catalogs the current automation prompt assets, maps them to supporting workflows/scripts, and recommends upgrades to strengthen the Portfolio OS Home Automation system.

> Note: Script existence/paths verified against `C:\Users\jschi\OneDrive\Desktop\2025_portfolio\portfolio-os` at the time of writing.

## 1. Prompt Catalog & Gaps

| Document | Intent & Audience | Current Completeness | Gaps / Immediate Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `issue-management-prompt-engineering.md` | End-to-end strategy for AI-driven issue/PR/project automation; audience = automation engineers configuring GitHub Actions + PowerShell. | Comprehensive narrative (principles, templates, architecture) but lacks ownership/status and implementation checkpoints. | References scripts (`issue-config-unified.ps1`, `ai-enhanced-pr-automation.ps1`) and workflows that do not exist in the main repo; duplicates implementation steps already in `integration-implementation-guide.md`; no versioning or change log. |
| `github-issue-auto-configuration.md` | Field mapping and manual/CLI recipes for consistent issue setup; audience = contributors running scripts locally. | Contains up-to-date project IDs/options (as of 2025-01-07) and thorough CLI snippets. | Primary script `scripts/auto-configure-issue-updated.ps1` missing; field IDs lack validation guardrail; preset guidance is static (no AI pathway); no linkage to `issue-analysis-prompt-template.md`. |
| `integration-implementation-guide.md` | Phase-based rollout plan for completing automation stack; audience = maintainers executing roadmap. | Detailed checklist + step-by-step instructions with code samples. | Depends on seven missing scripts (auto-configure-pr, pr-automation-unified, docs-updater, continuous-issue-pipeline, issue-queue-manager, issue-implementation, ai-services); PowerShell snippets assume directories such as `scripts/automation/issue-management` that are absent; checklist status stale. |
| `issue-analysis-prompt-template.md` | Canonical AI prompt for analyzing GitHub issues; audience = PowerShell/GitHub Actions integrators. | Highly detailed template with JSON contract and integration notes. | Does not document escaping/placeholder constraints; assumes helper `Invoke-AICompletion` exists; no examples of failed responses or validation; duplicative criteria vs. `issue-management-prompt-engineering.md`. |
| `pr-automation-prompt-template.md` | AI prompt for PR analysis + CR-GPT responses. | Rich guidance incl. response templates and GitHub Actions sample. | References helper scripts `ai-pr-analyzer.ps1`, `post-cr-gpt-responses.ps1`, `update-pr-status.ps1` that do not exist; lacks mapping to `pr-automation-optimized.yml`; does not specify rate limits / token strategy. |
| `workflow-evaluation-report.md` | Audit of current automation coverage. | Clear snapshot of missing components and phased recommendations. | Last updated before latest repo changes; relies on same missing script list; duplicates recommendations from `integration-implementation-guide.md`; does not track remediation progress or owners. |

## 2. Prompt  Workflow/Script Coverage

| Prompt / Doc | Intended Script(s) / Workflow(s) | Current Implementation Status | Notes / Blockers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `issue-management-prompt-engineering.md` | `scripts/automation/issue-management/issue-config-unified.ps1`, `scripts/ai-enhanced-issue-config.ps1`, GitHub workflow `orchestrate-issues-prs.yml` | Scripts/workflow paths absent in repo; only legacy references in worktrees. | Need to port or recreate the unified issue config + AI wrapper in `/scripts/automation`. |
| `github-issue-auto-configuration.md` | `scripts/auto-configure-issue-updated.ps1`, `scripts/set-estimate-iteration.ps1`, manual `gh project item-edit` commands | Neither script located in repo root; manual commands usable but undocumented in automation toolchain. | Either reintroduce scripts from worktrees or update doc to reflect manual-only path. |
| `integration-implementation-guide.md` | `orchestrate-issues-prs.yml`, `pr-automation-optimized.yml`, AI services module, `auto-configure-pr.ps1`, `pr-automation-unified.ps1`, `docs-updater.ps1`, `continuous-issue-pipeline.ps1`, `issue-queue-manager.ps1`, `issue-implementation.ps1` | Workflows exist but call non-existent scripts; AI services module not present; rest of scripts missing. | Requires script creation + workflow patching before guide is actionable. |
| `issue-analysis-prompt-template.md` | `Invoke-AIIssueAnalysis` helper inside `issue-config-unified.ps1`, GitHub Action step `AI Issue Analysis`, PowerShell utility `ai-issue-analyzer.ps1` | No helper or analyzer script in repo; workflow lacks AI step; template currently theoretical. | Must build shared AI client (`core-utilities/ai-services.ps1`) plus analyzer wrapper. |
| `pr-automation-prompt-template.md` | `ai-pr-analyzer.ps1`, `post-cr-gpt-responses.ps1`, `update-pr-status.ps1`, workflow `pr-automation-optimized.yml` | Workflow exists but does not call AI analyzer; none of the helper scripts exist. | Need PR data fetch + response posting scripts aligned with CR-GPT conventions. |
| `workflow-evaluation-report.md` | Cross-checks all workflows (`orchestrate-issues-prs.yml`, `pr-automation-optimized.yml`, `project-status-automation.yml`, `add-to-project.yml`) and scripts listed above | Report matches current state (missing scripts) but lacks automated verification. | Consider generating report from scripted audit to keep findings fresh. |

### Coverage Insights

1. **Zero prompt is currently executable end-to-end** because every template references helper scripts that are missing from the main workspace.  
2. **GitHub Actions workflows run but degrade**: they reference non-existent scripts, so steps will fail or are commented out.  
3. **PowerShell tree gap**: `scripts/automation/` currently holds only documentationno `.ps1` filesso automation is effectively broken.  
4. **AI layer untreated**: `Invoke-AICompletion`, prompt templating, and API key handling exist only in docs, not code.

## 3. Recommended Enhancements

### Immediate (restore functionality)

- **Recreate core scripts** (`auto-configure-pr.ps1`, `pr-automation-unified.ps1`, `docs-updater.ps1`, `continuous-issue-pipeline.ps1`, `issue-queue-manager.ps1`, `issue-implementation.ps1`, `ai-services.ps1`) under `scripts/automation/`, sourced from historical worktrees or rebuilt from doc snippets.
- **Patch workflows** (`.github/workflows/orchestrate-issues-prs.yml`, `pr-automation-optimized.yml`) to reference the restored scripts and add failure guards when scripts are missing.
- **Add repository-wide `Invoke-AICompletion` utility** with provider abstraction and secure secret loading; document usage inline with prompts.

### Near-Term (stabilize AI-driven prompts)

- **Version each prompt file** (front-matter with `version`, `owner`, `last_reviewed`) and link to the script/workflow implementing it.
- **Create prompt validation harness** (e.g., `scripts/automation/tests/prompt-contract.ps1`) that runs JSON schema checks against AI responses for the issue/PR templates.
- **Attach usage guides**: embed How to trigger steps within each prompt doc, referencing CLI + workflow triggers once scripts return.
- **Consolidate duplicated content** by splitting strategy (`issue-management-prompt-engineering.md`) from implementation guide; cross-link instead of restating long sections.

### Future (optimize & monitor)

- **Automation metrics layer**: add `scripts/automation/monitoring/automation-metrics.ps1` to log success/failure counts and feed into dashboards.
- **Security & ops guardrails**: centralize API key management, rate limiting, and audit logging guidance inside `prompts/automation/security.md`.
- **Learning loop**: implement telemetry to capture AI recommendation accuracy and feed back into prompt tuning (documented in `issue-analysis-prompt-template.md`).

## 4. Next Steps & Validation

1. **Source missing scripts** from `worktrees/agent-*` and port them (with updates) into `scripts/automation/`.  
2. **Update workflows** to fail fast with descriptive errors if dependencies are absent.  
3. **Run dry-run tests** for issue + PR flows, confirming prompts generate valid JSON and that GitHub field updates succeed using `gh project item-edit`.  
4. **Schedule quarterly prompt reviews**: capture owners, success metrics, and backlog items directly in each doc.

Once these actions are complete, the Home Automation system will have a documented, testable bridge between prompt strategy and executable workflows.

# Automation Security & Ops Guardrails

## API Key Management
- Store OpenAI/Anthropic keys in GitHub Actions secrets (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
- For local use, prefer `.env.local` files ignored by Git and load via `$env:OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Rotate keys quarterly and immediately after suspected leaks.

## Secret Ingestion
```powershell
# Example
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = (Get-Content ./secrets/openai.key -Raw).Trim()
```

## Rate Limiting
- Default concurrency: 2 issues per queue, 1 PR automation job per PR number.
- `pr-automation-unified.ps1` batches AI calls and backs off exponentially on HTTP 429/503.
- Use `issue-queue-manager.ps1 -MaxConcurrent <N>` to cap automation throughput.

## Audit Logging
- All automation scripts log to `logs/automation/*.log`. Metrics collector parses:
  - `ISSUE_PROCESSED` lines from `continuous-issue-pipeline.ps1`
  - `PR_ANALYZED` lines from `pr-automation-unified.ps1`
  - `ERROR` lines from any script exceptions

## Manual Overrides
- Set `DRY_RUN_RESPONSES=true` in workflows to prevent auto-commenting.
- Pass `-DryRun` to any PowerShell helper for a side-effect-free preview.
- Use `scripts/automation/project-manager.ps1 -Operation status` before running watchers.

## Quarterly Review Checklist
1. Run `scripts/automation/tests/prompt-contract.ps1` and fix failures.
2. Revalidate workflow references to ensure script paths are current.
3. Rotate API keys & ensure secrets are scoped to required repos only.
4. Review automation logs for anomalous spikes in failures or API calls.

# GitHub Issue Auto-Configuration Prompt

## Purpose
Automatically configure GitHub issues with proper project fields, labels, and milestone assignments for the Portfolio OS project.

## Execution
- Primary script: `pwsh ./scripts/automation/issue-config-unified.ps1 -IssueNumber <ID> -Preset <blog|dashboard|docs|infra> -AddToProject`
- Alternate script: `pwsh ./scripts/automation/auto-configure-issue-updated.ps1` (legacy syntax)
- Manual fallback: run `gh project item-edit` commands in the sections below when automation cannot run.

## Usage
When creating or updating GitHub issues, use this automation to ensure consistent project field configuration.

## Available Scripts

### 1. Updated Configuration Script (Recommended)
**File:** `scripts/auto-configure-issue-updated.ps1`

**Usage:**
```powershell
# Basic configuration
.\scripts\auto-configure-issue-updated.ps1 -IssueNumber 190 -Priority "P1" -Size "M" -App "Portfolio Site" -Area "Frontend"

# Full configuration with estimate and milestone
.\scripts\auto-configure-issue-updated.ps1 -IssueNumber 190 -Priority "P1" -Size "M" -App "Portfolio Site" -Area "Frontend" -Estimate 3 -Milestone "Sprint 1" -Labels "ready-to-implement"
```

### 2. Set Estimate and Iteration
**File:** `scripts/set-estimate-iteration.ps1`

**Usage:**
```powershell
# Set estimate only
.\scripts\set-estimate-iteration.ps1 -IssueNumber 190 -Estimate 3

# Set both estimate and iteration
.\scripts\set-estimate-iteration.ps1 -IssueNumber 190 -Estimate 3 -Iteration "Sprint 1"
```

### 3. Legacy Scripts (Deprecated)
**Files:** `scripts/auto-configure-issue.ps1`, `scripts/auto-configure-issue-simple.ps1`

**Note:** These scripts use GraphQL mutations which can fail silently. Use the updated scripts above instead.

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]

jobs:
  configure-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Configure Issue
        run: |
          # Add your automation logic here
          echo "Configuring issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}"
```

## Manual Configuration Commands

### Set Project Fields (Recommended Method)
```bash
# Get issue ID
ISSUE_ID=$(gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER --json id -q .id)

# Get project item ID
PROJECT_ITEM_ID=$(gh api graphql -f query='query($issueId: ID!) { node(id: $issueId) { ... on Issue { projectItems(first: 10) { nodes { id project { id title } } } } } }' -f issueId=$ISSUE_ID | jq -r '.data.node.projectItems.nodes[0].id')

# Update fields using gh project item-edit (RECOMMENDED)
# Priority
gh project item-edit --id $PROJECT_ITEM_ID --field-id "PVTSSF_lAHOAEnMVc4BCu-czg028qQ" --project-id "PVT_kwHOAEnMVc4BCu-c" --single-select-option-id "0a877460"

- **Updated field IDs** to current project structure

### What's New
- **Estimate field** - Set story points (1-20 days)
- **Iteration field** - Assign to sprints/iterations
- **Simplified syntax** - No complex GraphQL mutations needed
- **Better debugging** - Clear error messages and status updates

## Best Practices

1. **Use the updated scripts** (`auto-configure-issue-updated.ps1`) for reliability
2. **Set estimate values** for better sprint planning (1-20 days)
3. **Set milestone** for issue tracking and sprint planning
4. **Use appropriate labels** for filtering and organization
5. **Configure all project fields** for proper project board organization
6. **Test the automation** with a test issue before using in production
7. **Check field IDs** if project structure changes using `gh project view 20 --json fields`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Issue not found:** Verify issue number exists
- **Project not found:** Ensure issue is added to the correct project
- **Field update fails:** Use `gh project item-edit` instead of GraphQL mutations
- **Permission denied:** Ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated
- **GraphQL mutations succeed but don't update:** This is a known issue - use `gh project item-edit` instead

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check GitHub CLI authentication
gh auth status

# List available projects
gh project list

# View issue details
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER --json id,projectItems

# Get current project field values
gh project view 20 --json fields

# Test individual field update
gh project item-edit --id PROJECT_ITEM_ID --field-id FIELD_ID --project-id PROJECT_ID --single-select-option-id OPTION_ID
```

### Why Use `gh project item-edit` Instead of GraphQL?
- **GraphQL mutations can "succeed" but not actually update fields** - this is a known GitHub API issue
- **`gh project item-edit` is more reliable** - it directly updates the project fields
- **Better error handling** - clearer success/failure feedback
- **Simpler syntax** - no need to construct complex GraphQL mutations

## Integration with Development Workflow

1. **Create issue** using GitHub CLI or web interface
2. **Run automation script** to configure project fields
3. **Issue appears** in project board with correct status and priority
4. **Begin development** with proper project tracking

## Maintenance

- **Update field IDs** if project structure changes
- **Add new presets** for different issue types
- **Test automation** regularly with new issues
- **Document changes** to configuration options

# PR Automation Prompt Template

## **Purpose**
This template provides structured prompts for AI agents to analyze pull requests, generate intelligent responses to CR-GPT feedback, and manage PR automation workflows for the Portfolio OS project.

## Execution
- Primary script: `pwsh ./scripts/automation/pr-automation-unified.ps1 -PRNumber <ID> -Action <analyze|respond|quality|docs|all>`
- Dependencies: GitHub CLI (`gh`), optional AI provider (OpenAI via `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Fallback: run `./scripts/automation/auto-configure-pr.ps1 -PRNumber <ID>` to set project metadata when AI is unavailable.

## **Placeholder Contracts**
| Placeholder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{PR_NUMBER}` | Pull request number |
| `{PR_TITLE}` / `{PR_DESCRIPTION}` | Copy from PR metadata |
| `{BASE_BRANCH}` | Destination branch |
| `{CHANGED_FILES}` | Comma-separated file paths |
| `{LINES_CHANGED}` | Human-readable stats string |
| `{CI_STATUS}` / `{REVIEW_STATUS}` | Workflow + review states |
| `{CR_GPT_COMMENTS}` | JSON array of CR-GPT comment payloads |

# Default Two-Agent PR Assignment Strategy
## Template for PR Distribution Between Two Specialized Agents

## **Pre-Assignment Checklist**

Before assigning PRs to agents, verify:
- [ ] All PRs target the correct base branch (usually `develop` or `main`)
- [ ] PRs are properly labeled and prioritized

** Real-time Project Board Updates:**
- **Backlog**  **In progress** (when work starts)
- **In progress**  **Ready** (when PR is created and in review)
- **Ready**  **Done** (when PR is merged successfully)

**Queue Processing Features:**
- **Priority-based ordering** (P0 > P1 > P2 > P3)
- **Dependency checking** (waits for blocked issues)
- **Concurrent processing** (configurable limits per queue)
- **Failure recovery** (resume from failed issues)
- **Real-time monitoring** (watch mode with intervals)
- **Comprehensive logging** (detailed pipeline logs)

**For Issues:**
- Use `.\scripts\issue-config-unified.ps1 -IssueNumber <NUMBER> -Preset blog -AddToProject`
- Auto-configure project fields (Status=In progress, Priority=P1, Size=M, App=Portfolio Site, Area=Frontend, Assignee=jschibelli)
- Analyze requirements and generate implementation plan
- **CRITICAL**: Create branch from `develop` base using `.\scripts\create-branch-from-develop.ps1 -IssueNumber <NUMBER>`
- Track progress and update status

**For PRs:**
- **CRITICAL**: Verify base branch is set to `develop` - automation MUST NOT proceed if base branch is `main`
- Use `.\scripts\pr-automation-unified.ps1 -PRNumber <NUMBER> -Action all -AutoFix` (AutoFix automatically corrects base branch)
- Monitor CR-GPT bot comments and reviews
- Analyze feedback with priority categorization (bugs > tests > typing > logic > docs > style)
- Generate threaded replies to CR-GPT comments
- Run quality checks (lint, test, build)
- Update project status and metadata
- Drive to merge with rebase merge strategy (only if base branch is `develop`)
- Update documentation and changelog

**Universal Features:**
- Real-time monitoring and notifications
- Automated testing and validation
- Security and performance analysis
- Documentation updates
- Status tracking and reporting
- ** NEW**: Continuous pipeline processing
