# Tendril Multi-Tenant Chatbot SaaS: From Market Research to MVP Strategy

## Problem Statement

Small and medium businesses (SMBs) are increasingly frustrated with existing chatbot solutions that fail to meet their unique needs. Despite the growing demand for AI-powered customer support, current market leaders like Intercom, Drift, and newer entrants like Chatbase create significant barriers for SMBs through unpredictable pricing, complex setup processes, and inadequate support for multi-client management.

The core problem identified through extensive market research reveals three critical pain points:

**Pricing Transparency Crisis**: SMBs report bill increases of up to 120% with existing solutions due to hidden usage fees and confusing pricing models. Intercom's per-seat pricing with AI add-ons ($0.99 per resolution) creates unpredictable costs that can devastate small business budgets.

**Setup Complexity Barrier**: Despite claims of being "no-code," existing solutions overwhelm small teams with enterprise-grade complexity. Users report spending weeks configuring chatbots that should work immediately.

**Multi-Tenant Gap**: Agencies and developers managing chatbots for multiple clients face a critical infrastructure gap. Current solutions force them to maintain separate subscriptions for each client.

## Research & Analysis

Comprehensive market research across user reviews, forums, and competitive analysis revealed a landscape ripe for disruption.
