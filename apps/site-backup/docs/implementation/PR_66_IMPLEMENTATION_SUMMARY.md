```

### Component Architecture

```typescript
interface Feature {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
  image?: string;
  link?: string;
}

interface FeatureGridProps {
  features: Feature[];
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  className?: string;
  maxColumns?: 2 | 3 | 4;
  showIcons?: boolean;
  onFeatureClick?: (feature: Feature) => void;
}
```

### Error Handling Patterns

```typescript
// Input validation with graceful fallbacks
if (!features || !Array.isArray(features)) {
  console.error('FeatureGrid: features prop must be an array');
  return <ErrorFallback message="Invalid features data provided" />;
}

// Feature validation with filtering
const validFeatures = features.filter(feature => {
  if (!feature?.id || !feature?.title || !feature?.description) {
    console.warn('FeatureGrid: Invalid feature object:', feature);
    return false;
  }
  return true;
});
```
