# Case Study Structure Guide

## Overview

All case studies in this blog follow a standardized 7-section structure to ensure consistency and provide readers with a predictable, comprehensive reading experience.

## Standardized Sections

Every case study must include these 7 sections in this exact order:

### 1. Problem Statement

**Purpose:** Define the problem or challenge that needed to be solved
**Content:**

- Clear description of the problem
- Context and background
- Why this problem matters
- Stakeholders affected

### 2. Research & Analysis

**Purpose:** Market research, competitive analysis, and data gathering
**Content:**

- Market research findings
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Data and metrics gathered
- Key insights discovered

### 3. Solution Design

**Purpose:** Architecture, approach, and design decisions
**Content:**

- Technical architecture
- Design decisions and rationale
- Technology choices
- System design considerations

### 4. Implementation

**Purpose:** Technical implementation, development process, and execution
**Content:**

- Development process
- Technical implementation details
- Challenges encountered
- Solutions implemented

### 5. Results & Metrics

**Purpose:** Outcomes, performance metrics, and measurable results
**Content:**

- Quantitative results
- Performance improvements
- Business impact
- Key metrics achieved

### 6. Lessons Learned

**Purpose:** Key insights, challenges overcome, and takeaways
**Content:**

- What worked well
- What didn't work
- Key learnings
- Recommendations for others

### 7. Next Steps

**Purpose:** Future plans, improvements, and ongoing development
**Content:**

- Future roadmap
- Planned improvements
- Ongoing development
- Long-term vision

## Technical Implementation

### Table of Contents

The table of contents is automatically generated from the standardized structure and always shows these 7 sections in order. The TOC includes:

- **Desktop:** Sticky sidebar on the right
- **Mobile:** Collapsible overlay accessible via "Table of Contents" button
- **Scrolling:** Smooth scroll to sections when TOC items are clicked
- **Active State:** Highlights current section based on scroll position

### ID Generation

Each section heading automatically gets an ID generated from its title:

- `problem-statement`
- `research-analysis`
- `solution-design`
- `implementation`
- `results-metrics`
- `lessons-learned`
- `next-steps`

### Validation

The system validates that all case studies include the required sections. Missing sections will be flagged during the build process.

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

1. **Problem Statement:** Be specific and measurable
2. **Research & Analysis:** Include data and competitive insights
3. **Solution Design:** Explain the "why" behind decisions
4. **Implementation:** Focus on key technical challenges
5. **Results & Metrics:** Use specific numbers and data
6. **Lessons Learned:** Share actionable insights
7. **Next Steps:** Provide clear future direction

### Writing Tips

- Keep each section focused and concise
- Use specific examples and data
- Include relevant images, diagrams, or code snippets
- Maintain a consistent tone throughout
- End each section with a clear transition to the next

### Special Blocks

You can use special markdown blocks within sections:

```markdown
:::comparison
Column1, Column2, Column3
Value1, Value2, Value3
:::

:::kpis
label, value
Metric1, 100
Metric2, 50%
:::

:::gallery
url, alt
image1.jpg, Description 1
image2.jpg, Description 2
:::

:::pricing
Plan, Price, Features
Basic, $10, Feature 1
Pro, $20, Feature 2
:::

:::cta
title, subtitle, ctaText, href
Title, Subtitle, Button Text, /link
:::
```

## Examples

See the test case study at `/test-case-study-demo` for a complete example of the standardized structure in action.

## Tools and Utilities

The following utilities are available for working with case studies:

- `generateStandardizedTOC()` - Generate TOC items
- `validateCaseStudyStructure()` - Validate markdown content
- `getMissingSections()` - Find missing sections
- `createNewCaseStudy()` - Create new case study with template
- `CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE` - Markdown template string

## Maintenance

This structure ensures:

- **Consistency** across all case studies
- **Predictability** for readers
- **Completeness** of information
- **Professional presentation**
- **Easy navigation** and reference

All case studies should follow this structure to maintain quality and consistency across the blog.
