# Site Audit Report

## Overview
This report documents the comprehensive audit of the portfolio website to ensure all pages are properly connected, there are no 404s or dead ends, and case studies are properly linked.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Tendril Project in Main Index
**Issue**: The Tendril project was defined in `data/projects/tendrilo.ts` and included in `lib/project-utils.ts` but was missing from the main `data/projects/index.ts` file.

**Fix**: Added Tendril project to the main projects index:
- Added `tendrilo` import and export
- Added `tendrilo` to the `allProjects` array
- Ensured proper ordering with Tendril as the first featured project

### 2. Missing Case Studies Pages
**Issue**: Case studies were referenced in project data but no actual pages existed to display them.

**Fix**: Created complete case studies routing:
- Created `/app/case-studies/page.tsx` - Case studies index page
- Created `/app/case-studies/[slug]/page.tsx` - Individual case study pages
- Implemented proper metadata and SEO
- Added comprehensive case study content for Tendril

### 3. Case Study Content Integration
**Issue**: The Tendril case study existed in multiple formats but wasn't properly connected.

**Fix**: 
- Connected the existing MDX content in `content/case-studies/tendril.mdx`
- Created proper routing to display case studies
- Ensured case study links in project cards work correctly
