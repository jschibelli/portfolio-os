# Welcome to Portfolio OS Storybook

This is the component library for **Portfolio OS**, a modern portfolio platform built with Next.js 15, React 18, and TypeScript.

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is a development environment and playground for UI components. It allows you to:

- 🎨 **Browse components** - View all components in isolation
- 🔧 **Test variants** - Try different props and states
- 📚 **Documentation** - Learn how to use each component
- ♿ **Accessibility** - Test keyboard navigation and screen readers
- 📱 **Responsive** - View components across different viewports

## Quick Start

### Running Storybook

```bash
# Start Storybook development server
pnpm --filter @mindware-blog/site storybook

# Build Storybook for production
pnpm --filter @mindware-blog/site build-storybook
```

### Browsing Components

Use the sidebar to navigate through:

- **UI Components** - Basic building blocks (Button, Card, etc.)
- **Projects** - Feature components (Gallery, FeatureGrid)
- **Blog** - Blog-specific components
- **Features** - Complex feature components

## Component Categories

### UI Components
Core design system components that form the foundation of the application.
- Buttons, Cards, Badges
- Forms (Input, Select, Checkbox)
- Navigation, Dialogs, Tooltips

### Project Components
Components for showcasing projects and portfolio items.
- Gallery with lightbox
- Feature grids
- Case study layouts

### Blog Components
Specialized components for blog content.
- Post cards and headers
- Author info
- Table of contents
- Markdown renderers

## Using Components

Each component story includes:

1. **Interactive Demo** - Try the component with different props
2. **Props Documentation** - Complete API reference
3. **Code Examples** - Copy-paste ready code snippets
4. **Variants** - Different visual styles and states

## Best Practices

### Creating Stories

Stories should demonstrate:
- Default state
- All variants and sizes
- Edge cases (empty, error states)
- Interactive states (hover, focus, disabled)
- Responsive behavior

### Accessibility

All components should:
- Support keyboard navigation
- Include proper ARIA labels
- Maintain focus management
- Work with screen readers

## Development Workflow

1. **Develop** - Build components in isolation
2. **Document** - Write comprehensive stories
3. **Test** - Verify all variants work correctly
4. **Integrate** - Use components in the application
