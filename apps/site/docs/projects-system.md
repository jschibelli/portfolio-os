# Projects System Documentation

## Overview

The projects system allows you to create and manage case studies and portfolio projects that showcase your work. This system supports both database-driven case studies (via Prisma) and static portfolio projects (via JSON files), with a unified presentation layer that includes enhanced layouts, custom components, and interactive elements.

## Data Models

### Database Case Studies (Prisma)

Case studies stored in the database use the following schema:

```prisma
model CaseStudy {
  id              String        @id @default(cuid())
  title           String
  slug            String        @unique
  excerpt         String?
  content         String?       // MDX content
  status          ArticleStatus @default(DRAFT)
  visibility      Visibility    @default(PUBLIC)
  publishedAt     DateTime?
  featured        Boolean       @default(false)
  
  // Project details
  client          String?
  industry        String?
  duration        String?
  teamSize        String?
  technologies    String[]
  challenges      String?
  solution        String?
  results         String?
  metrics         Json?
  lessonsLearned  String?
  nextSteps       String?
  
  // Media and SEO
  coverImage      String?
  seoTitle        String?
  seoDescription  String?
  canonicalUrl    String?
  ogImage         String?
  
  // Engagement
  allowComments   Boolean       @default(true)
  allowReactions  Boolean       @default(true)
  views           Int           @default(0)
  
  // Tags and categories
  tags            String[]
  category        String?
  
  // Author and metadata
  authorId        String?
  author          User?         @relation("AuthorCaseStudies", fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  createdAt       DateTime      @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime      @updatedAt
}
```

### Static Portfolio Projects (JSON)

  "title": "Project Title",
  "slug": "project-slug",
  "description": "Brief project description",
  "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "tags": ["Next.js", "TypeScript", "React"],
  "liveUrl": "https://project-url.com",
  "caseStudyUrl": "/case-studies/project-slug"
}
```

## Standardized Case Study Structure

All case studies must follow this 7-section structure [[memory:7711529]]:

### 1. Problem Statement
Define the problem or challenge that needed to be solved.

### 2. Research & Analysis
Market research, competitive analysis, and data gathering.

### 3. Solution Design
Architecture, approach, and design decisions.

### 4. Implementation
Technical implementation, development process, and execution.

### 5. Results & Metrics
Outcomes, performance metrics, and measurable results.

### 6. Lessons Learned
Key insights, challenges overcome, and takeaways.

### 7. Next Steps
Future plans, improvements, and ongoing development.

## MDX Integration

### Available Components

The system provides several custom MDX components for enhanced case study presentation:

#### Fenced Blocks

Use triple colon syntax for special components:

```markdown
:::pricing
Plan, Price, Features, Target Market
Free, $0, Basic features, Individuals
Pro, $49, Advanced features, Small teams
Enterprise, $199, Full features, Large organizations
:::
```

**Available Block Types:**

1. **`pricing`** - Pricing comparison tables
2. **`comparison`** - Feature/competitor comparison tables
3. **`metrics`** - Key performance indicators grid
4. **`techstack`** - Technology stack showcase
5. **`marketing`** - Marketing sites and performance
6. **`quote`** - Testimonial quotes
7. **`timeline`** - Project timeline visualization
8. **`gallery`** - Image galleries
9. **`cta`** - Call-to-action sections

#### React Components

Available in MDX content:

- `<MetricsCard>` - Individual metric display
- `<ComparisonTable>` - Enhanced comparison tables
- `<QuoteCard>` - Styled testimonial cards
- `<TimelineCard>` - Project phase visualization
- `<TechnologyStackCard>` - Tech stack showcase
- `<PricingAnalysisCard>` - Pricing model analysis

### MDX Template

Use this template for new case studies:

```markdown

## Adding New Projects

### Method 1: Database Case Study (Recommended)

1. **Create via API:**
   ```bash
   POST /api/case-studies
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "title": "Project Title",
     "excerpt": "Brief description",
     "content": "# Project Title\n\n## Problem Statement\n...",
     "technologies": ["Next.js", "TypeScript"],
     "tags": ["case-study", "web-development"],
     "client": "Client Name",
     "industry": "Technology",
     "duration": "3 months",
     "teamSize": "3 developers"
   }
   ```

2. **Create via Admin Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to `/admin/case-studies`
   - Click "Create New Case Study"
   - Fill in required fields
   - Use the MDX editor for content
   - Save as draft or publish

### Method 2: Static Portfolio Project

1. **Edit `data/portfolio.json`:**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "new-project",
     "title": "New Project",
     "slug": "new-project",
     "description": "Project description",
     "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg",

     "liveUrl": "https://project-url.com",
     "caseStudyUrl": "/case-studies/new-project"
   }
   ```

2. **Create corresponding case study page:**
   - Create `pages/case-studies/new-project.tsx`
   - Follow the case study template structure
   - Include all required sections

### Method 3: Hashnode Integration

1. **Create Hashnode Post:**
   - Tag with `case-study`
   - Follow standardized structure
   - Include fenced blocks for enhanced content
   - Use proper frontmatter

2. **Automatic Detection:**
   - System automatically detects `case-study` tagged posts
   - Applies enhanced case study layout
   - Renders custom components
