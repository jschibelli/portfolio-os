# Chatbot Environment Configuration Fix

## Issue

The chatbot is experiencing errors because the `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` environment variable is malformed (set to just `{`).

## Quick Fix

### Option 1: Use Mock Data (Recommended for Testing)

The chatbot will now automatically fall back to mock data when the Google Calendar configuration is invalid. This allows you to test the chatbot functionality without setting up Google Calendar integration.

### Option 2: Fix Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env.local` file with the correct values:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Google Calendar Configuration (OPTIONAL - only if you want real calendar integration)
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=./google-service-account.json
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=your-calendar-id@gmail.com

# Feature Flags
FEATURE_SCHEDULING=true
FEATURE_CASE_STUDY=true
FEATURE_CLIENT_INTAKE=true
```

### Option 3: Disable Google Calendar Integration

If you don't need real calendar integration, you can remove the Google Calendar environment variables entirely. The chatbot will use mock data automatically.

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed**: The chatbot now handles malformed environment variables gracefully
✅ **Working**: Mock data will be used when Google Calendar is not properly configured
✅ **Functional**: All chatbot features work with mock scheduling data

## Testing

The chatbot should now work without errors. When users request scheduling, they'll see mock available time slots that demonstrate the booking flow.

## Cost-Effective Model Recommendation

Your current `gpt-4o-mini` configuration is optimal for cost-effectiveness:

- **Model**: `gpt-4o-mini` (Standard tier)
- **Cost**: $0.15 input / $0.60 output per 1M tokens
- **Features**: Full tool support for scheduling, case studies, and intake forms
- **Quality**: High-quality responses with good reasoning

This is the most cost-effective option that supports all your chatbot's features.
