# Case Studies Authoring Guide

This guide explains how to create case studies for the Hashnode-based Next.js site using the custom case study layout and fenced blocks.

## Overview

Case studies are special blog posts that showcase real-world solutions, technical implementations, and business outcomes. They use a custom layout with enhanced features like sticky table of contents, wider content containers, and custom fenced blocks.

## Creating a Case Study

### 1. Tag Requirements

**Required:** Tag your post with `case-study` to enable the special layout.

```markdown
---
title: 'Building a Multi-Tenant Chatbot Platform'
tags: ['case-study', 'chatbot', 'saas']
---
```

### 2. Recommended Section Structure

Follow this structure for comprehensive case studies:

1. **Problem Statement** - What challenge needed solving?
2. **Research & Analysis** - How did you approach the problem?
3. **Solution Design** - What solution did you create?
4. **Implementation** - How did you build it?
5. **Results & Metrics** - What were the outcomes?
6. **Lessons Learned** - What insights did you gain?
7. **Next Steps** - What's next?

### 3. Using Fenced Blocks

Case studies support special fenced blocks that render as interactive components. These blocks start with `:::blocktype` and end with `:::`.

#### Pricing Table

```markdown

#### Call-to-Action

```

**Features:**

## Fenced Block Syntax Rules

### Parsing Rules

1. **Block Format:** `:::blocktype` to `:::`
2. **Header Row:** First non-empty line = comma-separated headers
3. **Data Rows:** Following lines = comma-separated data
4. **Quoted Cells:** Use quotes to include commas in cell content
5. **Blank Lines:** Ignored during parsing
6. **Unknown Types:** Render as `<pre>` fallback

### Best Practices

1. **Consistent Formatting:** Keep headers and data aligned
2. **Descriptive Headers:** Use clear, concise column names
3. **Relevant Data:** Only include necessary information
4. **Mobile Consideration:** Keep table content concise for mobile viewing

## Layout Features

### Sticky Table of Contents

- **Desktop:** Fixed sidebar with scroll tracking
- **Mobile:** Slide-out overlay with toggle button
- **Auto-generated:** Built from `h2` and `h3` headings
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Click to jump to sections

### Wider Content Container

- **Standard Posts:** `md:max-w-screen-md`
- **Case Studies:** `max-w-none` for better table readability
- **Responsive:** Adapts to screen size

### Footer CTA Slot

- **Automatic:** Appears at bottom of case study content
- **Customizable:** Can be overridden with custom CTA blocks
- **Strategic:** Encourages engagement
