# Contact Form Analysis & Issues

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** 🔴 **BLOCKER - Not Working**  
**Priority:** Critical - Blocking versioning

## Executive Summary

The contact form is currently **not functional** in production. While the form appears to work from a user perspective (validation passes, success message shown), emails are never sent and no data is persisted. This creates a critical issue where potential clients believe they've contacted you, but no communication actually occurs.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing Environment Configuration ⚠️
- **No `.env.local` file** exists in the development environment
- **Missing `RESEND_API_KEY`** - Required for email service
- **Missing `EMAIL_FROM`** and `EMAIL_REPLY_TO`** - Email configuration
- No validation or warnings when environment is misconfigured

### 2. Silent Email Failures ⚠️
- Email service catches errors but returns success
- API endpoint returns `200 OK` even when emails fail
- Users see "Message Sent!" when message was never sent
- No admin notifications of failures

### 3. No Data Persistence ⚠️
- Contact submissions are **not saved to database**
- If email fails, data is permanently lost
- No way to recover or follow up with submissions
- No admin interface to view submissions

### 4. Production Deployment Gaps ⚠️
- No documentation for Vercel environment variable setup
- No deployment checklist
- No health check endpoints
- No monitoring or alerting

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact
- **Lost Opportunities:** Potential clients contact you but never receive responses
- **Professional Reputation:** Poor user experience and lack of follow-up
- **Revenue Loss:** Cannot convert interested leads
- **Trust Issues:** Users may think form is fake or company is unresponsive

### Technical Impact
- **Data Loss:** No record of who tried to contact you
- **No Analytics:** Cannot track form usage or conversion rates
- **No Audit Trail:** No way to prove compliance or track interactions
- **Silent Failures:** Issues go undetected until users complain

## Quick Fix (Temporary)

If you need a working contact form immediately while fixes are implemented:

1. **Get Resend API Key:**
   - Sign up at https://resend.com (free)
   - Get API key from dashboard

2. **Create `.env.local` file:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/site
   echo "RESEND_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env.local
   echo "EMAIL_FROM=noreply@schibelli.dev" >> .env.local
   echo "EMAIL_REPLY_TO=john@schibelli.dev" >> .env.local
   ```

3. **Restart dev server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Test the form** - Should now send emails

**Note:** This is a temporary fix. Issues #280 and #281 still need to be addressed for production.
