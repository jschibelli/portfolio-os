									My journey into development started in an unexpected place—teaching web development 
									at Anthem Institute, where I discovered my passion for turning complex problems into 
									elegant solutions. That experience shaped my philosophy: great code isn&apos;t just 
									functional, it&apos;s teachable, maintainable, and built with the end user in mind.
								</p>
								<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 dark:text-stone-300">
									Today, I&apos;m a senior front-end developer with over 15 years of experience, 
									but I still approach every project with that educator&apos;s mindset. Whether I&apos;m 
									building React applications, incubating AI-powered tools like SynaplyAI, or crafting 
									enterprise UIs for financial platforms, I believe in creating solutions that not only 
									work beautifully but can be understood and maintained by the next developer.
								</p>
								<p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-stone-700 dark:text-stone-300">
									Based in Towaco, NJ, I specialize in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, 
									with a particular focus on accessibility and SEO. My unique approach combines technical 
									excellence with clear communication—because the best code is the kind that tells a story 
									anyone can follow.
