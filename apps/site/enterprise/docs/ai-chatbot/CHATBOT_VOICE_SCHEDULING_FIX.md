# Chatbot Voice and Scheduling Interface Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Voice Settings - Now Disabled by Default

**Problem**: Voice was enabled by default (`useState(true)`)
**Solution**: Changed to disabled by default (`useState(false)`)

### 2. Scheduling Interface Not Opening

**Problem**: UI permission flow had issues with localStorage checking
**Solution**: Fixed permission checking logic and added comprehensive debugging

## Changes Made

### Voice Settings

- **File**: `components/ui/Chatbot.tsx`
- **Change**: Line 68 - Changed `useState(true)` to `useState(false)`
- **Result**: Voice is now disabled by default

### Scheduling Interface

- **File**: `components/ui/Chatbot.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed `checkUIPermission()` function to properly return permission status
  - Added comprehensive debugging logs throughout the UI action flow
  - Added test buttons for manual testing

### Debugging Added

- Added console logs to track UI action flow
- Added test buttons for manual testing of booking modal and voice
- Enhanced error handling and logging

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Voice Settings

1. Open the chatbot
2. Look for the purple test voice button (next to settings)
3. Click it to test voice functionality
4. Check console for voice status logs

### 2. Test Scheduling Interface

1. Open the chatbot
2. Look for the blue calendar test button (next to settings)
3. Click it to manually trigger the booking modal
4. Check console for UI action logs

### 3. Test Natural Flow

1. Open the chatbot
2. Type: "I want to schedule a meeting"
3. Check console for UI action logs
4. If permission dialog appears, click "Allow"
5. Booking modal should open

## Console Debugging

The following console logs will help debug issues:

- `üîç Received UI actions from API:` - Shows when UI actions are received
- `üîç handleUIAction called with:` - Shows UI actions being processed
- `üîç Processing UI action:` - Shows individual action processing
- `üîç UI permission status:` - Shows permission status
- `üîç Stored UI permission:` - Shows localStorage permission value
- `üîç executeUIAction called with:` - Shows action execution
- `üîç Opening booking modal with data:` - Shows booking modal opening

## Permission Flow

1. **First Time**: Permission dialog appears
2. **Allow**: Permission stored in localStorage, modal opens
3. **Deny**: Permission stored as denied, modals won't open
4. **Reset**: Clear localStorage to reset permission

## Voice Flow

1. **Default**: Voice disabled
2. **Enable**: Click voice button to enable
3. **Test**: Use purple test button to verify voice works
4. **Disable**: Click voice button again to disable

## Troubleshooting

### If Scheduling Interface Still Doesn't Open:

1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Look for `üîç` prefixed debug logs
3. Check if permission dialog appears
4. Verify localStorage has correct permission value

### If Voice Doesn't Work:

1. Check if voice is enabled (green speaker icon)
2. Check browser console for voice-related errors
3. Verify browser supports speech synthesis
4. Test with purple test button

### Reset Everything:

1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Clear localStorage for the domain
4. Refresh the page
5. Test again
