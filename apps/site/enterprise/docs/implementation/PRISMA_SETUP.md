## ✅ Current Status

- **Persist client leads** for follow-up
- **Track case study views** for analytics
- **Scale beyond local development**

## 📊 Database Tables

### Booking

- Stores meeting appointments created by the chatbot
- Fields: name, email, timezone, start/end times, meeting type, notes, status

### Lead

- Stores client intake form submissions
- Fields: name, email, company, role, project details, budget, timeline

### CaseStudyView

- Fields: case study ID, chapter ID, visitor ID, view timestamp

## 🔧 Development

- **Prisma Studio**: Run `npx prisma studio` to view/edit data
- **Schema changes**: Edit `prisma/schema.prisma` then run `npx prisma db push`
- **Reset database**: Run `npx prisma db push --force-reset` (⚠️ deletes all data)

## 🚀 Production

Your Vercel Postgres database is ready for production deployment. The chatbot will automatically use real database storage instead of mocks.
