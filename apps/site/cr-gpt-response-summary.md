## âœ… Issues Addressed

### 1. **Fixed .gitignore Configuration** (Comment ID: 2371028223)
**Issue**: Missing proper exclusions for Turborepo build artifacts and logs.
**Fix Applied**: Updated `.gitignore` to include:
```
# Turborepo
.turbo/
**/.turbo/

# Build logs and temporary files
*.log
**/*.log
*.tmp
*.temp

# Turbo cache
.turbo/cache/
```

### 2. **Enhanced CI/CD Workflow** (Comment ID: 2370847220)
**Issue**: Workflow configuration needed optimization for Turborepo structure.
**Fix Applied**: Added build verification step to CI workflow:
```yaml
- name: Build application
  run: pnpm --filter @mindware-blog/site build

- name: Check for build artifacts
  run: |
    if [ -d "apps/site/.next" ]; then
      echo "Build successful - .next directory created"
    else
      echo "Build failed - .next directory not found"
      exit 1
    fi
```
