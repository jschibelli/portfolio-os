RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here

# ============================================
# Email Configuration
# ============================================
# EMAIL_FROM must be a verified domain in Resend
# For development, you can use resend's test domain: onboarding@resend.dev
# For production, use your own verified domain: noreply@yourdomain.com

EMAIL_FROM=noreply@schibelli.dev

# Optional: Email address for replies to contact form submissions
EMAIL_REPLY_TO=john@schibelli.dev

# ============================================
# Setup Instructions
# ============================================
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local in the apps/site directory
# 2. Sign up at https://resend.com (free tier available)
# 3. Get your API key from https://resend.com/api-keys
# 4. Replace 'your_resend_api_key_here' with your actual API key
# 5. Update EMAIL_FROM and EMAIL_REPLY_TO with your email addresses
# 6. For production, verify your domain in Resend dashboard

# ============================================
# Testing Setup
# ============================================
# For local development/testing without sending real emails:
# - Set NODE_ENV=test
# - The email service will use mock implementations

# For testing with Resend's test domain:
# - RESEND_API_KEY=your_test_api_key
# - EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev

# ============================================
# Production Deployment (Vercel)
# ============================================
# 1. Go to Vercel Dashboard > Your Project > Settings > Environment Variables
# 2. Add the following variables:
#    - RESEND_API_KEY (production API key from Resend)
#    - EMAIL_FROM (your verified domain email)
#    - EMAIL_REPLY_TO (your reply-to email)
# 3. Apply to Production environment
# 4. Redeploy your application

# ============================================
# Validation
# ============================================
# The application includes environment validation that will:
# - Warn if RESEND_API_KEY is missing (in non-test environments)
# - Use fallback values for EMAIL_FROM and EMAIL_REPLY_TO
# - Return proper error codes when email service is not configured
