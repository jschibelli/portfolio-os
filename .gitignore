# Git Ignore Configuration for Portfolio OS Monorepo
# =============================================================================
# This file defines patterns for files and directories that should be excluded
# from version control. These patterns help maintain a clean repository by
# ignoring build artifacts, dependencies, temporary files, and user-specific
# configurations that should not be shared across development environments.
#
# Guidelines for adding new patterns:
# - Group related patterns under descriptive section headers
# - Use consistent commenting style with clear explanations
# - Consider both local development and CI/CD environments
# - Test patterns to ensure critical files are not accidentally ignored

# =============================================================================
# Dependencies and Package Management
# =============================================================================
# Node.js dependencies - these are installed via package managers and should
# not be committed to version control as they can be regenerated from package.json
