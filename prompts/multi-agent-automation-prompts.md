```
Intelligent issue assignment: Analyze issue #[NUMBER] for complexity, required skills, dependencies, and optimal agent assignment. Provide detailed analysis and assignment recommendation with justification.
```

### **Agent Coordination**
```
Coordinate agents: Manage multi-agent coordination for complex projects requiring multiple agents. Handle dependencies, integration points, and workflow synchronization.
```

### **Conflict Resolution**
```
Resolve agent conflicts: Identify and resolve conflicts between agents working on related code. Coordinate integration and prevent merge conflicts.
```

## üìä **Monitoring and Analytics Prompts**

### **Agent Performance Analysis**
```
Agent performance analysis: Analyze performance metrics for each agent including work completion rates, quality scores, efficiency metrics, and optimization opportunities.
```

### **System Analytics**
```
Multi-agent system analytics: Provide comprehensive analytics on system performance, agent utilization, issue processing efficiency, and overall automation effectiveness.
```

### **Quality Metrics**
```
Quality metrics analysis: Analyze code quality, test coverage, security metrics, and performance indicators across all agent work. Identify areas for improvement.
```

## üö® **Troubleshooting Prompts**

### **System Diagnostics**
```
Multi-agent system diagnostics: Diagnose system issues including agent failures, work tree problems, state synchronization issues, and coordination failures.
```

### **Agent Recovery**
```
Agent recovery procedures: Recover failed agents, restore work tree integrity, resolve state conflicts, and restart agent operations.
```
