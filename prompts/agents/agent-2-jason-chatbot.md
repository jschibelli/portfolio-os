## üí¨ Review Comments Examples

### Approve
```markdown
**Backend Review - LGTM**

Reviewed API route changes thoroughly. Everything looks good:

‚úÖ Streaming implementation is efficient
‚úÖ Error handling is comprehensive
‚úÖ Token usage optimized
‚úÖ No security concerns
‚úÖ Performance is acceptable

Tested locally and streaming works smoothly. Great work!
```

### Request Changes
```markdown
**Backend Review - Minor Changes Needed**

Good implementation overall, but found a few items to address:

**Required Changes:**
1. **Token Usage:** Consider limiting context to last 10 messages instead of 15 to reduce costs
2. **Error Handling:** Add retry logic for transient OpenAI API errors

**Optional Improvements:**
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Consider caching frequent requests

Let me know when these are addressed and I'll re-review!
```

### Ask Questions
```markdown
**Backend Review - Clarification Needed**

Implementation looks solid, but I have a few questions:

1. **Token Usage:** What's the average token count per request with 15 message context?
2. **Error Handling:** Are we logging errors for debugging? Where?
3. **Performance:** Have you load-tested the streaming with multiple concurrent users?

Once clarified, I can approve!
```
